      <description>🤞🏻&#xA;continuously updating this blog since 29th may 2025&#xA;I usually post work updates on this website but I wanted to share my experience of doing the CHOP Protocol somewhere, because whilst there are a few videos online, I struggled to find complete blogs that didn’t taper off after a few months. Also, my doctors don’t know what it is and maybe yours don’t either. I will return to this page each month to share an update for anyone interested.</description>

      <description>every other sunday, I post a review on thewhitepube.com; every other sunday, Zarina does. Here&amp;rsquo;s all the things I wrote about in 2025, which definitely didn&amp;rsquo;t end up being every other sunday due very poor health at the start of the year, and then a summer spent writing a book with Z that should be out winter &amp;lsquo;26 with Particular Books/Penguin Random House. Stay tuned : )&#xA;The subjects also follow my health, beginning with books, and then moving into live events as the year progresses:</description>

      <description>While Zarina is out doing press for our book Poor Artists IRL at festivals (latitude! edinburgh international book festival!) I&amp;rsquo;m taking care of the online stuff. Plaster have a podcast called Give Me A Break, discussing people&amp;rsquo;s entry into the arts. I was interviewed by Harriet Lloyd-Smith and ye sure it was probably supposed to a chance to talk about Poor Artists but I accidentally gave my life story instead. I remember it being very funny to record so hopefully it&amp;rsquo;s a funny listen :-)</description>

      <description>My current health crash has coincided with the big 5 year Covid-in-the-UK anniversary and with the Labour government&amp;rsquo;s new eugenic campaign. So I have been giving quotes to people, then reading them back thinking &amp;lsquo;I should have been meaner about all of this.&amp;rsquo;&#xA;I spoke to Creative Review about about the impact of Long Covid on the creative industry&#xA;I spoke to James Grieg for Dazed about how Labour&amp;rsquo;s benefit cuts will impact disabled artists</description>

      <description>year 1 of long covid, I was practically housebound. year 2, I got the POTS diagnosis, medication for POTS, and I clawed my way outside. year 3, I got covid a second time, became twice as sick, and returned to life inside one room where I used what little energy I had remaining to write a book. Come year 4, I was dragged back out by a book tour because I was stupid enough to write a book.</description>

      <description>on apr 3rd i&amp;rsquo;ll be at Dead Ink Bookshop to talk &amp;ldquo;GOBLINHOOD: GOBLIN AS A MODE,&amp;rsquo; an essay and poem collection by Jen Calleja that artfully propound her theory of &amp;ldquo;Goblin-hood&amp;rdquo; - taking in all aspects of pop culture from film, literature and art as well as the author&amp;rsquo;s personal and original examinations of grief, lust, family histories and the physical fact of living in the world as it is. Inventive, wild and tricky - a curious, visceral addition to Calleja’s remarkable oeuvre.</description>

      <description>on march 27th, I will be joining Orian Brook, Dave O&amp;rsquo;Brien and Mark Taylor at Blackwell&amp;rsquo;s in Manchester to discuss the updated version of their book Culture is Bad for You. You can book a ticket for the event here. This all came about because at the end of 2024, after being on a panel with Orian for Edinburgh&amp;rsquo;s Radical Book Fair, I posted a text about how much money I have earned as a writer since I began in 2015.</description>

      <description>I did a flying visit to London Art Fair to speak about our book Poor Artists. We were in conversation with Verity Babbs who was precise and funny and good at turning the book inside-out for anyone in the audience who hadn&amp;rsquo;t read it yet. BookBar were outside the door selling Poor Artists, and BookBar were great as well. And then I came home, ill, and I wrote this text about the experience of visiting the world of extreme wealth for one weird afternoon.</description>

      <description>I am only really doing this blog post because I thought this picture was funny. Oh and also because it&amp;rsquo;s useful to me to know what I&amp;rsquo;ve done? My work is so weird. But I got invited to teach at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich on the Jour Fixe lecture series. Had my coat on ready to go to Manchester Airport aaand the snow cancelled my flight. So, no in-person lecture or studio visits.</description>

      <description>2020 was surreal, 2021 was the worst year of my life, 2022 was a mental hangover, 2023 was isolating but very creative, 2024 was social and vast and celebratory, and I hope 2025 is safe at the very least. But also rich. I hope 2025 is a moneybags year.&#xA;The Poor Artists book tour continues. I&amp;rsquo;m in Munich next week, then London Art Fair, and in Feb there are events in Bath and Liverpool.</description>

      <title>Poor Artists is out in the UK AND North America  🍋</title>

      <description>The book is now out in the UK and North America and things are going well. The reviews for Poor Artists have been almost exclusively really, really positive. More important than reviews are just normal people&amp;rsquo;s opinions and we&amp;rsquo;re getting the same message a lot &amp;ndash; that people feel like we have given them permission to make art for themselves again, the way they used to, instead of making it for the sake of the art industry or in the pursuit of being a professional artist.</description>

      <description>In April, I spent a week in an old mill in France. I was invited over to review the residency experience itself, but I also made some time to start a new book. It was a great week, but kinda sad to think about how rare it is, as any sort of maker, to have time and space to do that making. I wrote about the residency and the financial context that artists are currently operating in -&amp;gt;</description>

But I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually write an essay. When I first sat down to watch it, I was struck by how many video game references it held and I decided to instead write about it in the style of a walkthrough.</description>

      <description>This is nice. Photoworks invited me to be on a panel for the 2024 annual summit about access in art festivals, but instead of getting loads of trains to Brighton or Zooming in, I asked if I could submit a photo. I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking lots of film photos over the past year and there was one on my mind, of the mold on my bathroom ceiling. After starting my Culture at Home column on Elephant, I thought it was funny to see that in terms of another kind of culture.</description>

      <description>BOOK ANNOUNCEMENT!!!!&#xA;On October 3rd 2024, Poor Artists will be published thanks to Penguin&amp;rsquo;s imprint Particular Press in the UK and Prestel in the US.&#xA;&amp;lsquo;At a moment in which working as a professional artist is an increasingly unattainable luxury, art criticism duo The White Pube investigate why so many artists try anyway. Labelled “the Diet Prada of the art world” by British Vogue, in Poor Artists writers Gabrielle de la Puente and Zarina Muhammad ridicule a contemporary art world that has turned art into artworks, art schools into art universities, and creative expression into cut-throat competition.</description>

The second instalment went up in December, and it was on Photowork&amp;rsquo;s Festival in a Box project. Aaand I just checked back today to see the third text is up now too. The third one is on a Youtuber called shiey who takes himself places he&amp;rsquo;s not supposed to, and posts the evidence online.</description>

      <description>As The White Pube, we used to write an advice column for Elephant. Elephant changed hands, the column got cut, and then we got a message from the new team asking if we wanted to pick it back up again. I think we were both dishing out advice. There&amp;rsquo;s only so much we know. So, we had a think about things we would genuinely like to do and I proposed an individual column about Culture at Home.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t write any reviews over the summer because I had to write a 2nd draft of the book I am working on with ZM, but critic-me is back momentarily, and I can very much feel the effect of writing on a book on my criticism. My latest text is a roundabout review written from the perspective of an artist called Cody Senn. In my text, he&amp;rsquo;s called The Maggot Man.</description>

      <description>Last night, I interviewed Alison Rumfitt to help promo the launch of her 2nd novel Brainwyrms. I&amp;rsquo;ve asked the event hosts Dead Ink Bookshop to make the recording available, and I&amp;rsquo;ll link that here once it&amp;rsquo;s up. But it was a good chat. Lots of laughs considering the extreme social horror category of her subject matter. I only asked her half the questions I had prepared because we got so deeply into the Internet as a setting, as inspiration, as a traumatising entity, and as a place that generates endless language for writers to work with.</description>

      <description>I just posted the special edition of The White Pube podcast that we made in partnership with Nando&amp;rsquo;s. You can listen or read the transcription here. It was a great and also genuinely surprising and uplifting week learning more about the company invests in Southern African art &amp;ndash; art, something no one in the world can truly expect a return on investment from. It&amp;rsquo;s support for support&amp;rsquo;s sake. It&amp;rsquo;s mad? and good?</description>

      <description>I got early access to Downpour, an app that allows you to make games from your phone. And I thought, ok, whaaaaat am I gonna do. And then I made this. And I keep making that, keep making it bigger and more helpful and more loopy, hiding secret links, making more drawings on a Microsoft Paint simulator. I made a game slash website slash personal carer. People of the Salt is a way for me to triage myself when I&amp;rsquo;m sick but the sickness is making it difficult to remember what I need to do to counter it.</description>

I know I never drank water. But then I got Covid and Long Covid and Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome and now all I do is stress about what I am going to eat.</description>

      <description>in summer 2022, I published a 6k word review about a twitter account called Chaotic Nightclub Photos. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time to write it but I had fun. And then after I&amp;rsquo;d had my fun, Rough Trade Books got in touch asking if I would like to write a longer version as a part of their upcoming nightlife series. Yes pleaseee. More time to figure out what I wanted to say, more opportunity to put Gossip and Art History in there.</description>

I like knitting, Overwatch, octagonal glasses, cousins, learning Chilean Spanish, and sitting one on one with a best friend in a restaurant for so long that all the tables around you change characters multiple times.&#xA;I suffer a pie-chart of freelancing. I am an Associate Lecturer at Central Saint Martins &amp;amp; I assist an author.

      <description>I was on the 2023 jury for the BAFTA Game Awards for the Multiplayer category. I am very glad Elden Ring won. Chaotic choice in the eyes of some people, but I think it was doing the most to advance the multiplayer genre. &amp;lsquo;You need help and you can have help but only at great, finicky, risky cost&amp;rsquo; was so in keeping with the game&amp;rsquo;s narrative and challenge level. I was including the gamer-to-gamer peer-to-peer world that exists outside of a game, as well as the co-op that happens inside, and there&amp;rsquo;s no way I could have come to enjoy Elden Ring as much as I did without the player-built knowledge base around it.</description>

We don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip; do fashion. But the event was like a massive exhibition. 10(??) (man I&amp;rsquo;m so tired i can&amp;rsquo;t remember) co-created collections were revealed for London Fashion Week in the form of installations rather than catwalk shows.</description>

      <description>As The White Pube, we haven&amp;rsquo;t done a Big Proper Official interview in a while. To be honest, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything new to say. Everything already existed in tweets and reviews and whatnot, so we turned them down for a while. Now felt like a good time to reintroduce ourselves through a very measured interview with the Norweigan publication Kunstkritikk. You can read the piece here in English or Norweigan.</description>

      <description>The White Pube is currently in residency in Sirius Arts Centre in Cobh, County Cork, Ireland. It&amp;rsquo;s our first official live-in residency in 7 years. We&amp;rsquo;re here for 16 whole days. It&amp;rsquo;s been very, very productive so far.&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;re writing a book at the moment, which is something I cannot speak about in earnest because of other people&amp;rsquo;s marketing timelines. But that is why we are here. Director Miguel Amado, who we&amp;rsquo;ve known for years now, got in touch to ask if there was any way Sirius might be able to support us at the moment &amp;ndash; not knowing about the book panic we were feeling.</description>

      <description>In terms of teaching, I&amp;rsquo;ve only ever done lectures and tutorials for art students, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been winging it this entire time (winging it might be harsh, but lecturing on my work as the white pube feels innately like a fluke). So, it was nice to be excited down to Leeds Beckett to teach on Game Studies, and for it to not be a lecture but an actual 2.5 hour lesson.</description>

      <description>I wanted to nip onto my personal site to share that The White Pube is doing a brief partnership with Mubi to promote the release of the African Desperate by Martine Syms. We are producing a review, social media posts, a podcast discussion in audio+video &amp;amp; we are also offering our readers 30 days of mubi for free. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of Mubi so I&amp;rsquo;m really happy about it and I&amp;rsquo;m sharing it here to celebrate :)</description>

      <description>I spend so much time on youtube because i am on a friend&amp;rsquo;s premium plan, and I recently decided I should convert some content from The White Pube (which has been exclusively written + audio for years) into videos. Everyone loves videos. The algorithm loves videos. I love videos. So I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing things like this &amp;gt;&#xA;here&amp;rsquo;s a review in video form:&#xA;here&amp;rsquo;s a podcast in video form:</description>

      <description>I recently chaired an event at Birmingham Museum &amp;amp; Art Gallery on the closing weekend of the Found Cities, Lost Objects: Women in the City exhibition. The panel comprised of Lubaina Himid, Sumaya Kassim, Dawinder Bansal and Selina Thompson. We spoke about existing in this country through a cost of living crisis, surviving in buildings and systems designed without women in mind. The talk was co-produced by BMAG and The WOW Foundation.</description>

      <description>99% of my work involves writing but every so often I get to work in a curatorial capacity. Tour de Moon got in touch to ask if we could find 4 young game developers under the age of 25. They wanted to commission people to make games that responded to typical game tropes, and they also had to use the zany aesthetic of the wider festival. Neon, marble effects, big shapes, abstract settings.</description>

      <description>i spoke to Teen Vogue about Long Covid. I re-read what I said and I thought &amp;lsquo;wow, that&amp;rsquo;s dramatic&amp;rsquo; and then stopped and realised how dramatic this whole thing really is.&#xA;&amp;lsquo;Since long-haul COVID left Gabrielle housebound, sometimes she finds herself wanting only to talk to other chronically ill people. “They’re the only people that get it,” the 27-year-old says. Her life — once so expansive, full of work, travel, and plans to learn to drive a car and visit new countries — has shrunk.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, I had an appointment with the Long Covid Clinic in Liverpool (that has recently changed hands, moving from Aintree hospital to a health centre in Speke). I described all the symptoms I’d been going through for the past year and the doctor said it sounds very much like I fall into the dysautonomic phenotype when it comes to Long Covid - - like the virus has messed up by autonomic nervous system and that’s why I &amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>deets:&#xA;Community Radio Tbilisi presents a monthly radio show A Beautiful Staircase in an Abandoned Building (ABSAB) by Ben Tupper, that explores the soundtracks of video games across various genres and console platforms. Each month, ABSAB features cuts of video game soundtracks curated around various cultural themes and selected by a guest artist with an affiliation for or working within video game culture. Video game soundtracks can be particularly unique in how they generate associations between memory, space and affect.</description>

      <description>I thought it would be good to keep track of how I have (and haven’t) received support for Long Covid in Liverpool. By good I mean useful for other people in the same position. By good I also maybe mean an interesting document for people with other post viral illnesses who are looking at the reaction to Long Covid and feeling some type of way. So, this is my shitty timeline.</description>

      <description>this summer, Zarina and I released our first print publication as The White Pube in the form of a pamphlet for Rough Trade Books. It is #10 on their best seller list for 2021 which is cool!&#xA;You can purchase the pamphlet here: https://www.roughtrade.com/gb/the-white-pube/ideas-for-a-new-art-world/pamphlet-plus&#xA;&amp;lsquo;We are The White Pube and this pamphlet collects our ideas for a new art world. The art world is a bit broken. So many problems, such little time.</description>

This is the result:&#xA;Find The Haven of Aves here: https://davidblandy.itch.io/lost-eons-haven-of-aves&#xA;&amp;lsquo;A setting for LOST EONS based in a future Liverpool, an avian world of haves and have-nots. Featuring Art by Harriet Burns and a short story by Gabrielle de la Puente, enter a future world of water, misery and defiance.&#xA;Working with students at the Liverpool School of Art and Design at Liverpool John Moores University, Gabrielle de la Puente and David Blandy have created a future vision of Liverpool after climate collapse, that eerily echoes our own.</description>

      <description>My first full year writing game reviews was a weird one - deeply concentrated on games, still understanding what they are and what they can do, all the while deep in my feelings becoming housebound from Long Covid. It was really helpful for me to write about being sick in order to process everything and make peace with it (if making peace is even possible). But I also resented writing about sickness, even when I felt the need to, because I hated how it would get stuck in my throat.</description>

      <description>I was invited to write about Long Covid for the Spring 2021 edition of Real Review. It was exciting because the Pope wrote something in the issue before me. I decided to look at all my symptoms, and reflect on how much my life had changed. It was the first time I&amp;rsquo;d sat down to write about LC and LC only, and it killed me to do so. At first, I actually regretted writing this because I haaaadn&amp;rsquo;t quite wanted to deal with how big of a change this had been for me.</description>
