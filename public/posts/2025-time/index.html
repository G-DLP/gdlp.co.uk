			<p>2020 was surreal, 2021 was the worst year of my life, 2022 was a mental hangover, 2023 was isolating but very creative, 2024 was social and vast and celebratory, and I hope 2025 is safe at the very least. But also rich. I hope 2025 is a moneybags year.</p>
<p>The Poor Artists book tour continues. I&rsquo;m in <a href="https://www.adbk.de/de/aktuell/veranstaltungsreihen/jour-fixe.html">Munich</a> next week, then <a href="https://www.londonartfair.co.uk/poor-artists-book-launch/">London Art Fair</a>, and in Feb there are events in <a href="https://www.toppingbooks.co.uk/events/bath/poor-artists-gabrielle-de-la-puente-and-zarina-muhammad-as-the-white-pube-2025-3/">Bath</a> and <a href="https://deadinkbookshop.com/products/poor-artists-the-white-pube-in-conversation-with-fran-disley">Liverpool</a>. The book was recently longlisted for the Gordon Burn prize, and the paperback will be out at some point this year.</p>
<p>My new year&rsquo;s resolution is to continue inhaling the Spanish language so that, health permitting, I can visit Chile in 2026 without embarrassing myself. I&rsquo;m on the hunt for links with arts professionals and residencies in Chile that could get me over there</p>
<p>I have collected a few more freelance jobs recently. Financially, spiritually, biologically, this is not what I was aiming for &ndash; I really want one contracted job with flexible hours that I can mostly or entirely do from home. If you happen to be reading this with a Gabrielle-shaped job in mind, please get in touch. Current collected jobs include writer, critic, access support for funding applications, evaluator for NPO-funded project, and soon-to-be tutor at an undisclosed London university. I <em>do</em> still live in Liverpool.</p>
<p>My health is still dire but it&rsquo;s not as dire as it was a few years ago. I continue to be riddled with POTS, meaning I&rsquo;m out of action during warmer months (hence me doing all my travelling this winter and spring). Every day is a puzzle of fatigue, orthostatic headaches, cognitive bullshit, dizziness, nausea, and wanting to shoot the moon, but I am a lot better at managing it, and friends and family are experienced nowadays too. It is sad to have such a long membership to the Long Covid club but I do insist on writing books and getting on planes and you should still definitely hire me for things because, well, look, I am the picture of health:</p>
