      <description>it&amp;rsquo;s been a year since our book Poor Artists came out which means it&amp;rsquo;s time for the paperback. We&amp;rsquo;re launching it at an event at Foyles where we&amp;rsquo;ll be in conversation with Morgan Quaintance. You can get a ticket here&#xA;we&amp;rsquo;re doing another event at Van Gogh House but that&amp;rsquo;s sold out so i won&amp;rsquo;t link it&amp;hellip;&#xA;and then something in manchester and norwich and newcastle but there&amp;rsquo;s no event listings yet so i&amp;rsquo;ll drop more links another time</description>

      <description>While Zarina is out doing press for our book Poor Artists IRL at festivals (latitude! edinburgh international book festival!) I&amp;rsquo;m taking care of the online stuff. Plaster have a podcast called Give Me A Break, discussing people&amp;rsquo;s entry into the arts. I was interviewed by Harriet Lloyd-Smith and ye sure it was probably supposed to a chance to talk about Poor Artists but I accidentally gave my life story instead. I remember it being very funny to record so hopefully it&amp;rsquo;s a funny listen :-)</description>

      <description>on apr 3rd i&amp;rsquo;ll be at Dead Ink Bookshop to talk &amp;ldquo;GOBLINHOOD: GOBLIN AS A MODE,&amp;rsquo; an essay and poem collection by Jen Calleja that artfully propound her theory of &amp;ldquo;Goblin-hood&amp;rdquo; - taking in all aspects of pop culture from film, literature and art as well as the author&amp;rsquo;s personal and original examinations of grief, lust, family histories and the physical fact of living in the world as it is. Inventive, wild and tricky - a curious, visceral addition to Calleja‚Äôs remarkable oeuvre.</description>

      <description>I did a flying visit to London Art Fair to speak about our book Poor Artists. We were in conversation with Verity Babbs who was precise and funny and good at turning the book inside-out for anyone in the audience who hadn&amp;rsquo;t read it yet. BookBar were outside the door selling Poor Artists, and BookBar were great as well. And then I came home, ill, and I wrote this text about the experience of visiting the world of extreme wealth for one weird afternoon.</description>

      <description>I am only really doing this blog post because I thought this picture was funny. Oh and also because it&amp;rsquo;s useful to me to know what I&amp;rsquo;ve done? My work is so weird. But I got invited to teach at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich on the Jour Fixe lecture series. Had my coat on ready to go to Manchester Airport aaand the snow cancelled my flight. So, no in-person lecture or studio visits.</description>

      <description>The book is now out in the UK and North America and things are going well. The reviews for Poor Artists have been almost exclusively really, really positive. More important than reviews are just normal people&amp;rsquo;s opinions and we&amp;rsquo;re getting the same message a lot &amp;ndash; that people feel like we have given them permission to make art for themselves again, the way they used to, instead of making it for the sake of the art industry or in the pursuit of being a professional artist.</description>

      <description>I was enjoying keeping track of all my work on this website but I stopped updating for a few months because my chronic illness (POTS) is much worse in summer, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing other things instead like: lying in bed and knitting and trying not to vomit and getting a kitten and knowing my book is coming out in October but not really feeling like somebody whose debut is coming out in October because I&amp;rsquo;ve just been lying in bed and knitting etc.</description>

      <description>In April, I spent a week in an old mill in France. I was invited over to review the residency experience itself, but I also made some time to start a new book. It was a great week, but kinda sad to think about how rare it is, as any sort of maker, to have time and space to do that making. I wrote about the residency and the financial context that artists are currently operating in -&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>first thing&amp;rsquo;s first, the link is here. second thing&amp;rsquo;s second, the link takes you to Black Dog Press&amp;rsquo;s monograph for artist Hardeep Pandhal where I wrote an essay about his video Riddles On Back Street. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually write an essay. When I first sat down to watch it, I was struck by how many video game references it held and I decided to instead write about it in the style of a walkthrough.</description>

      <description>I wrote a review of Poor Things &amp;ndash; the Alasdair Gray Archive said it was their favourite text about the film so far!&#xA;I watched Unrest and didn&amp;rsquo;t like it at all.&#xA;I got a little bored of writing about art-things and reviewed an experience instead.&#xA;And for my Culture at Home column, I wrote about Wolf Alice&amp;rsquo;s visual album for Blue Weekend.&#xA;And then a little on how meaningful it is to play games at home.</description>

      <description>BOOK ANNOUNCEMENT!!!!&#xA;On October 3rd 2024, Poor Artists will be published thanks to Penguin&amp;rsquo;s imprint Particular Press in the UK and Prestel in the US.&#xA;&amp;lsquo;At a moment in which working as a professional artist is an increasingly unattainable luxury, art criticism duo The White Pube investigate why so many artists try anyway. Labelled ‚Äúthe Diet Prada of the art world‚Äù by British Vogue, in Poor Artists writers Gabrielle de la Puente and Zarina Muhammad ridicule a contemporary art world that has turned art into artworks, art schools into art universities, and creative expression into cut-throat competition.</description>

      <description>At the end of 2023, I began writing a column for Elephant called Culture at Home. The first instalment was on knitting and L√¶rke Bagger&amp;rsquo;s book Close Knit. The second instalment went up in December, and it was on Photowork&amp;rsquo;s Festival in a Box project. Aaand I just checked back today to see the third text is up now too. The third one is on a Youtuber called shiey who takes himself places he&amp;rsquo;s not supposed to, and posts the evidence online.</description>

      <description>As The White Pube, we used to write an advice column for Elephant. Elephant changed hands, the column got cut, and then we got a message from the new team asking if we wanted to pick it back up again. I think we were both dishing out advice. There&amp;rsquo;s only so much we know. So, we had a think about things we would genuinely like to do and I proposed an individual column about Culture at Home.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t write any reviews over the summer because I had to write a 2nd draft of the book I am working on with ZM, but critic-me is back momentarily, and I can very much feel the effect of writing on a book on my criticism. My latest text is a roundabout review written from the perspective of an artist called Cody Senn. In my text, he&amp;rsquo;s called The Maggot Man.</description>

      <description>Last night, I interviewed Alison Rumfitt to help promo the launch of her 2nd novel Brainwyrms. I&amp;rsquo;ve asked the event hosts Dead Ink Bookshop to make the recording available, and I&amp;rsquo;ll link that here once it&amp;rsquo;s up. But it was a good chat. Lots of laughs considering the extreme social horror category of her subject matter. I only asked her half the questions I had prepared because we got so deeply into the Internet as a setting, as inspiration, as a traumatising entity, and as a place that generates endless language for writers to work with.</description>

      <description>in summer 2022, I published a 6k word review about a twitter account called Chaotic Nightclub Photos. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time to write it but I had fun. And then after I&amp;rsquo;d had my fun, Rough Trade Books got in touch asking if I would like to write a longer version as a part of their upcoming nightlife series. Yes pleaseee. More time to figure out what I wanted to say, more opportunity to put Gossip and Art History in there.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m not even close to where I was energy-wise but I am doing more. Make of that what you will. One of those doing-more-things involved writing a bizarro short story over 3 afternoons. I am just&amp;hellip; a little bit sick of reality, I guess. Little bit sick of sincerity.</description>
