      <description>I got early access to Downpour, an app that allows you to make games from your phone. And I thought, ok, whaaaaat am I gonna do. And then I made this. And I keep making that, keep making it bigger and more helpful and more loopy, hiding secret links, making more drawings on a Microsoft Paint simulator. I made a game slash website slash personal carer. People of the Salt is a way for me to triage myself when I&amp;rsquo;m sick but the sickness is making it difficult to remember what I need to do to counter it.</description>
