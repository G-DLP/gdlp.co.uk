      <description>on march 27th, I will be joining Orian Brook, Dave O&amp;rsquo;Brien and Mark Taylor at Blackwell&amp;rsquo;s in Manchester to discuss the updated version of their book Culture is Bad for You. You can book a ticket for the event here. This all came about because at the end of 2024, after being on a panel with Orian for Edinburgh&amp;rsquo;s Radical Book Fair, I posted a text about how much money I have earned as a writer since I began in 2015.</description>

      <description>I just posted the special edition of The White Pube podcast that we made in partnership with Nando&amp;rsquo;s. You can listen or read the transcription here. It was a great and also genuinely surprising and uplifting week learning more about the company invests in Southern African art &amp;ndash; art, something no one in the world can truly expect a return on investment from. It&amp;rsquo;s support for support&amp;rsquo;s sake. It&amp;rsquo;s mad? and good?</description>

Please visit! The show is excellent imo. It was a dream come true to be involved, and the resulting show is great thanks to the imaginations and persistence of the artists selected.</description>

      <description>Zarina and I had a chat with Zakia Sewell for her new BBC Radio 4 series &amp;lsquo;Taste.&amp;rsquo; We spoke about taste as an institutional force versus a personal one, our ethos with The White Pube, and why criticism is a sticky field in terms of power X_X&#xA;we&amp;rsquo;re in this episode: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001ng7h&#xA;full series: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001mt43/episodes/player&#xA;i like my occasional radio appearances. just seems so absurd :)</description>

      <description>A text I wrote in 2022 is finally out! The piece responded to Adonis Archontides&amp;rsquo;s artwork &amp;lsquo;Sensing is believing, believing is seeing&amp;rsquo; which was exhibited at the Nicosia Municipal Arts Centre in Cyrpus. The text is printed in booklets that open up into posters, so if you are lucky enough to pick one up in Cyprus, I hope you enjoy :)&#xA;The Past and the Present </description>

      <description>As The White Pube, we haven&amp;rsquo;t done a Big Proper Official interview in a while. To be honest, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything new to say. Everything already existed in tweets and reviews and whatnot, so we turned them down for a while. Now felt like a good time to reintroduce ourselves through a very measured interview with the Norweigan publication Kunstkritikk. You can read the piece here in English or Norweigan.</description>

      <description>The White Pube is currently in residency in Sirius Arts Centre in Cobh, County Cork, Ireland. It&amp;rsquo;s our first official live-in residency in 7 years. We&amp;rsquo;re here for 16 whole days. It&amp;rsquo;s been very, very productive so far.&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;re writing a book at the moment, which is something I cannot speak about in earnest because of other people&amp;rsquo;s marketing timelines. But that is why we are here. Director Miguel Amado, who we&amp;rsquo;ve known for years now, got in touch to ask if there was any way Sirius might be able to support us at the moment &amp;ndash; not knowing about the book panic we were feeling.</description>

The panel comprised of Lubaina Himid, Sumaya Kassim, Dawinder Bansal and Selina Thompson.

The talk was co-produced by BMAG and The WOW Foundation.</description>
