      <description>This is nice. Photoworks invited me to be on a panel for the 2024 annual summit about access in art festivals, but instead of getting loads of trains to Brighton or Zooming in, I asked if I could submit a photo.

After starting my Culture at Home column on Elephant, I thought it was funny to see that in terms of another kind of culture.</description>
