      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t really drop a picture here to make it more interesting because the work we did was as ephermal as the subject, so you&amp;rsquo;re just gonna have to believe me: in a funny turn of events, Dazed invited The White Pube to do an Instagram takeover at Moncler&amp;rsquo;s Art of Genius event in the Olympia, LDN. We don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip; do fashion. But the event was like a massive exhibition. 10(??) (man I&amp;rsquo;m so tired i can&amp;rsquo;t remember) co-created collections were revealed for London Fashion Week in the form of installations rather than catwalk shows.</description>
