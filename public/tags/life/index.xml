      <description>2020 was surreal, 2021 was the worst year of my life, 2022 was a mental hangover, 2023 was isolating but very creative, 2024 was social and vast and celebratory, and I hope 2025 is safe at the very least. But also rich. I hope 2025 is a moneybags year.&#xA;The Poor Artists book tour continues. I&amp;rsquo;m in Munich next week, then London Art Fair, and in Feb there are events in Bath and Liverpool.</description>

      <description>I did a blog post over on The White Pube about everything I made in 2023 across text and video, and reflected on how I managed to do anything at all given the fact my POTS is twice as bad as it was in 2022.&#xA;I also want to put it out to the Internet: if you are looking to give someone a 1 day a week job relating to writing, editing, social media, funding, community building or [insert the idea you had after reading the blog post aboout all the things I&amp;rsquo;m capable of] please get in touch on gabrielle@gdlp.</description>
