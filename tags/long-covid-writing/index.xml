there is a really good food newsletter called Vittles. I love and respect it. last month, I was thinking about how much I have to think about food nowadays, which is something I simply never used to do. Idk what I used to eat. Or drink. I know I never drank water. But then I got Covid and Long Covid and Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome and now all I do is stress about what I am going to eat.</description></item></channel></rss>
