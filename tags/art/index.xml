You can listen or read the transcription &lt;a href="http://thewhitepube.co.uk/podcasts/nandos/">here&lt;/a>. It was a great and also genuinely surprising and uplifting week learning more about the company invests in Southern African art &amp;ndash; art, something no one in the world can truly expect a return on investment from. It&amp;rsquo;s support for support&amp;rsquo;s sake. It&amp;rsquo;s mad? and good? And just not what I expected at all. We interview 3 artists who have worked with them &amp;ndash; Nkosinathi Quwe, Colijn Strydom, and Viven Kohler &amp;ndash; who were all brought over to exhibit at 154 art fair. The artists were thoughtful, the Nando&amp;rsquo;s team were fun. I really enjoyed putting this episode together and I hope you enjoy! 🌶&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>John Moores Painting Prize is open!</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/john-moores-painting-prize-open/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/john-moores-painting-prize-open/</guid><description>&lt;p>Very happy to see the fruit(s) of my labour, and other people&amp;rsquo;s bigger, much more important labour &amp;ndash; the &lt;a href="https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/jmpp/john-moores-painting-prize">John Moores Painting Prize 2023&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; is now open for all to enjoy, after months of jury-ing and 1 afternoon of curation. Please visit! The show is excellent imo. It was a dream come true to be involved, and the resulting show is great thanks to the imaginations and persistence of the artists selected. Met a lot of them at the opening last week! It was a really, really nice time. It is the most difficult job I have done up until this point (when the book is published, that title will transfer).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>spoke to BBC Radio 4 about taste</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/taste/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/taste/</guid><description>&lt;p>Zarina and I had a chat with Zakia Sewell for her new BBC Radio 4 series &amp;lsquo;Taste.&amp;rsquo; We spoke about taste as an institutional force versus a personal one, our ethos with The White Pube, and why criticism is a sticky field in terms of power X_X&lt;/p>

To be honest, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything new to say. Everything already existed in tweets and reviews and whatnot, so we turned them down for a while. Now felt like a good time to reintroduce ourselves through a very measured interview with the Norweigan publication Kunstkritikk. You can &lt;a href="https://kunstkritikk.com/critics-at-large/">read the piece here&lt;/a> in English or Norweigan. We were interview by Live Drønen, with new images taken by Maria Gorodeckaya. Thanks to everyone involved, it was a pleasure!!! let me take this opportunity to also say: I love Norway and I hope to one day go back / let me take this second opportunity to say: I am so glad I am finally tracking all of these little things that happen in my professional life because I haven&amp;rsquo;t ever done so on this scale, and it is doing wonders for my memory/sanity lol&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>liverpool day out 📸</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/liverpool-adventure/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/liverpool-adventure/</guid><description>&lt;p>this was fun to make:&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s our first official live-in residency in 7 years. We&amp;rsquo;re here for 16 whole days. It&amp;rsquo;s been very, very productive so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re writing a book at the moment, which is something I cannot speak about in earnest because of other people&amp;rsquo;s marketing timelines. But that is why we are here. Director &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/miguelcurator/">Miguel Amado&lt;/a>, who we&amp;rsquo;ve known for years now, got in touch to ask if there was any way Sirius might be able to support us at the moment &amp;ndash; not knowing about the book panic we were feeling. Living in two different cities to run TWP is fine but living in two different cities to write a TWP book is not.

&lt;p>The White Pube’s Gabrielle de la Puente said: “When I had free periods in sixth form, my art teacher used to send me to the Walker Art Gallery. I&amp;rsquo;d sit on my own in the room with the John Moores Painting Prize exhibition and get my arts education directly from all the paintings in there. When I became an art critic, I hoped I would get to be a juror on the prize one day, so this is a bit of a dream come true.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>in conversation with lubaina himid &amp; co</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/found-cities/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/found-cities/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently chaired an event at Birmingham Museum &amp;amp; Art Gallery on the closing weekend of the Found Cities, Lost Objects: Women in the City exhibition.

It is #10 on their best seller list for 2021 which is cool!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can purchase the pamphlet here: &lt;a href="https://www.roughtrade.com/gb/the-white-pube/ideas-for-a-new-art-world/pamphlet-plus">https://www.roughtrade.com/gb/the-white-pube/ideas-for-a-new-art-world/pamphlet-plus&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;We are The White Pube and this pamphlet collects our ideas for a new art world. The art world is a bit broken. So many problems, such little time. Between January-April 2021, we plastered the distilled thoughts of years of writing on billboards and posters across the UK. We wanted to plop these aphorisms out there, as simple, feasible solutions; almost to prove how easy it can be if change is sincerely sought. The ideas are not radical, and they’re not new. They’re just six Very Good Ideas that we think you should listen to. In this pamphlet, we’ve listed the six ideas and taken the time to explain why we think they are, in fact, Very Good Ideas. There could have been hundreds. Maybe there should have been. But these were the initial ideas for a new art world we went with. We hope they’ll make you think about more Very Good Ideas too.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Impact of Using Social Media as an Artist 👩🏻‍💻</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/art-report/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/art-report/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today, I am publishing the biggest thing I’ve ever written.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It is a document called ‘The Impact of Using Social Media as an Artist.’ Part report, it outlines how social media has become an important tool for work, networking and creativity. Part guide, it explains the differences between social media platforms, alongside tips, examples, and advice on safety and mental wellbeing online. Part conversation, it interviews different artists on their approach to social media (including Monique Jackson, v buckenham, the Kirkwood Brothers, Vince Laws, David Tovey and Babeworld). And part assessment, it looks at a recent commission that was shared on Instagram and Twitter to examine how arts organisations can best present artwork in online spaces.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
