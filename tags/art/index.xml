Please visit! The show is excellent imo. It was a dream come true to be involved, and the resulting show is great thanks to the imaginations and persistence of the artists selected. Met a lot of them at the opening last week! It was a really, really nice time.</description></item><item><title>spoke to BBC Radio 4 about taste</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/taste/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/taste/</guid><description>Zarina and I had a chat with Zakia Sewell for her new BBC Radio 4 series &amp;lsquo;Taste.&amp;rsquo; We spoke about taste as an institutional force versus a personal one, our ethos with The White Pube, and why criticism is a sticky field in terms of power X_X

To be honest, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything new to say. Everything already existed in tweets and reviews and whatnot, so we turned them down for a while. Now felt like a good time to reintroduce ourselves through a very measured interview with the Norweigan publication Kunstkritikk. You can read the piece here in English or Norweigan.</description></item><item><title>liverpool day out 📸</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/liverpool-adventure/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/liverpool-adventure/</guid><description>this was fun to make:</description></item><item><title>come to ireland with me ✈️</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/cobh-film/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/cobh-film/</guid><description>what i got up to in dec 2023:

It&amp;rsquo;s our first official live-in residency in 7 years. We&amp;rsquo;re here for 16 whole days. It&amp;rsquo;s been very, very productive so far.
We&amp;rsquo;re writing a book at the moment, which is something I cannot speak about in earnest because of other people&amp;rsquo;s marketing timelines. But that is why we are here. Director Miguel Amado, who we&amp;rsquo;ve known for years now, got in touch to ask if there was any way Sirius might be able to support us at the moment &amp;ndash; not knowing about the book panic we were feeling.</description></item><item><title>A-N Assembly on Access</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/a-n-assembly/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/a-n-assembly/</guid><description>At the weekend, I was part of A-N&amp;rsquo;s Assembly Leicester weekender that focused on disability rights, DIY activism and working in the arts.
