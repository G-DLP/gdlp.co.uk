It&amp;rsquo;s our first official live-in residency in 7 years. We&amp;rsquo;re here for 16 whole days. It&amp;rsquo;s been very, very productive so far.
We&amp;rsquo;re writing a book at the moment, which is something I cannot speak about in earnest because of other people&amp;rsquo;s marketing timelines. But that is why we are here. Director Miguel Amado, who we&amp;rsquo;ve known for years now, got in touch to ask if there was any way Sirius might be able to support us at the moment &amp;ndash; not knowing about the book panic we were feeling.</description></item><item><title>A-N Assembly on Access</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/a-n-assembly/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/a-n-assembly/</guid><description>At the weekend, I was part of A-N&amp;rsquo;s Assembly Leicester weekender that focused on disability rights, DIY activism and working in the arts.
