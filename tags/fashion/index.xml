We don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip; do fashion. But the event was like a massive exhibition. 10(??) (man I&amp;rsquo;m so tired i can&amp;rsquo;t remember) co-created collections were revealed for London Fashion Week in the form of installations rather than catwalk shows.</description></item></channel></rss>
