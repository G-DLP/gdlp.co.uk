We don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip; do fashion. But the event was like a massive exhibition. 10(??) (man I&amp;rsquo;m so tired i can&amp;rsquo;t remember) co-created collections were revealed for London Fashion Week in the form of installations rather than catwalk shows. We were brought in to do some art interpretation. It was a fun, mad night. Rick Owens put his arm around my shoulder and I thought he was Nick Cave. I am so good with celebrities because I literally do not recognise them. The takeover was fun tho and I hope we get invited back to do more if the fashion world ever does big mad exhibitions again xxxxx&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
