And I thought, ok, whaaaaat am I gonna do. And then I made &lt;a href="https://downpour.games/~gdlp/people-of-the-salt/">this&lt;/a>. And I keep making &lt;a href="https://downpour.games/~gdlp/people-of-the-salt/">that&lt;/a>, keep making it bigger and more helpful and more loopy, hiding secret links, making more drawings on a Microsoft Paint simulator. I made a game slash website slash personal carer. &lt;a href="https://downpour.games/~gdlp/people-of-the-salt/">People of the Salt&lt;/a> is a way for me to triage myself when I&amp;rsquo;m sick but the sickness is making it difficult to remember what I need to do to counter it. Wow, it&amp;rsquo;s like a game walkthrough for a very specific disability with my own specific fixes. Anyway, I love it. Loved making it. Will continue to update it and fly the flag for Downpour. It&amp;rsquo;s great.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
