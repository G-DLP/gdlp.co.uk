I used to run OUTPUT gallery alongside my work at The White Pube but I had to leave OUTPUT when I got Long Covid. I can&amp;rsquo;t go back to that job - it&amp;rsquo;s just too physical. I&amp;rsquo;m not 100% recovered but I&amp;rsquo;ve got enough life back in me to pick up a second job so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write this blog post.</description></item></channel></rss>
