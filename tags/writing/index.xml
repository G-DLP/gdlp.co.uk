The reviews for Poor Artists have been almost exclusively really, really positive. More important than reviews are just normal people&amp;rsquo;s opinions and we&amp;rsquo;re getting the same message a lot &amp;ndash; that people feel like we have given them permission to make art for themselves again, the way they used to, instead of making it for the sake of the art industry or in the pursuit of &lt;em>being a professional artist&lt;/em>. We&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of emotional emails from people. A lot of emotional chats after talks and interviews about the book with people who feel like their love of art became toxic, and now they&amp;rsquo;re trying to reconnect with this need to make things on their own terms. I&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot of travelling over the past two months for those events, and I hope we get to do lots more. It&amp;rsquo;s cool seeing it in shops, and especially nice that it is in so many bookshop window displays.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Poor Artists is out now 😗</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/poor-artists-book-out-now/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/poor-artists-book-out-now/</guid><description>&lt;p>The book came out!

&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve done interviews with Alastair Sooke for The Telegraph, Naga Munchetty for BBC Radio Five Live, James Grieg for Dazed, Ben Luke for The Art Newspaper. Readers are sending pictures of it in bookshops across the UK, including the White Cube bookshop loool (someone commented &amp;rsquo;the prophecy is fulfilled&amp;rsquo;). We did a launch at London Review Bookshop, and there are more events to come &amp;ndash; including a trip down to Margate, and one up to Edinburgh for the Radical Book Fair. Man, I just didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to feel this happy. It&amp;rsquo;s been so nice. If you read it and you feel things, please send me an email. I am screenshotting every comment I see about the book and adding it to a folder on my phone so I can hold onto this moment forever : )&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>do you want to see my kitten 🐈</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/september-sign-of-life/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/september-sign-of-life/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was enjoying keeping track of all my work on this website but I stopped updating for a few months because my chronic illness (POTS) is much worse in summer, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing other things instead like: lying in bed and knitting and trying not to vomit and getting a kitten and &lt;em>knowing&lt;/em> my book is coming out in October but not really &lt;em>feeling&lt;/em> like somebody whose debut is coming out in October because I&amp;rsquo;ve just been lying in bed and knitting etc. But here it is.

I was invited over to review the residency experience itself, but I also made some time to start a new book. It was a great week, but kinda sad to think about how rare it is, as any sort of maker, to have time and space to do that making. I wrote about the residency and the financial context that artists are currently operating in -&amp;gt;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hardeep Pandhal's Inheritance Quest is out April 30th 🚗</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/inheritance-quest/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/inheritance-quest/</guid><description>&lt;p>first thing&amp;rsquo;s first, the link is &lt;a href="https://blackdogonline.com/products/hardeep-pandhal-inheritance-quest">here&lt;/a>. second thing&amp;rsquo;s second, the link takes you to Black Dog Press&amp;rsquo;s monograph for artist Hardeep Pandhal where I wrote an essay about his video Riddles On Back Street. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually write an essay. When I first sat down to watch it, I was struck by how many video game references it held and I decided to instead write about it in the style of a walkthrough. It was a lot of fun. Made me want walkthroughs instead of press releases for all artworks. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave the piece I wrote about below, and hopefully it encourages you to pick up the monograph. I am such a Hardeep fan. I have been to exhibitions of us in Berwick, New York, Birmingham, London. Meant a lot to get to write about the magic density of his art.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>my Poor Things review has been translated 🧠</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/in-czech/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/in-czech/</guid><description>&lt;p>after I published a review of Poor Things, we got a really nice message from &lt;a href="https://revueprostor.cz">Revue Prostor&lt;/a> asking if they could translate the text into Czech for their website.

&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;lsquo;At a moment in which working as a professional artist is an increasingly unattainable luxury, art criticism duo The White Pube investigate why so many artists try anyway. Labelled “the Diet Prada of the art world” by British Vogue, in Poor Artists writers Gabrielle de la Puente and Zarina Muhammad ridicule a contemporary art world that has turned art into artworks, art schools into art universities, and creative expression into cut-throat competition.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Largest McDonald's in Europe 🦢</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/the-largest-mcdonalds-in-europe/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/the-largest-mcdonalds-in-europe/</guid><description>&lt;p>My first review of 2024 is called The Largest McDonald&amp;rsquo;s in Europe.

The first instalment was on &lt;a href="https://elephant.art/culture-at-home-on-knitting-and-laerke-baggers-book-close-knit/">knitting and Lærke Bagger&amp;rsquo;s book Close Knit&lt;/a>. The second instalment went up in December, and it was on &lt;a href="https://elephant.art/on-curation-renting-and-the-photoworks-festival-in-a-box/">Photowork&amp;rsquo;s Festival in a Box project&lt;/a>. Aaand I just checked back today to see the third text is up now too. The third one is on a &lt;a href="https://elephant.art/culture-at-home-on-shiey-youtubers-and-illegal-freedom/">Youtuber called shiey&lt;/a> who takes himself places he&amp;rsquo;s not supposed to, and posts the evidence online.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>should more artists rage bait online?</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/discontented/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/discontented/</guid><description>&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;Gabrielle de la Puente talks shitposting on instagram, the weight of digital attention, and the financial allure of being annoying online.&amp;rsquo; that&amp;rsquo;s me baby&lt;/p>

Elephant changed hands, the column got cut, and then we got a message from the new team asking if we wanted to pick it back up again. I think we were both dishing out advice. There&amp;rsquo;s only so much we know. So, we had a think about things we would genuinely &lt;em>like&lt;/em> to do and I proposed an individual column about Culture at Home. My time as a critic is split between the 2015-2020 era of being an international critic who was flying all over the place to see stuff, versus 2021-present, being a chronically ill critic who is almost always in the house. I have continued writing but I&amp;rsquo;ve never consciously said, this is all I &lt;em>can&lt;/em> write about. In this new column, I am doing exactly that. Column #1 is about Lærke Bagger&amp;rsquo;s book Close Knit. I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten really really really really really really really really into knitting this year, and Bagger&amp;rsquo;s book is one of those culture-things I have been able to fully appreciate without going outside. So here ya go.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>my first review in a while ✍🏻</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/maggot-man/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/maggot-man/</guid><description>&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t write any reviews over the summer because I had to write a 2nd draft of the book I am working on with ZM, but critic-me is back momentarily, and I can very much feel the effect of writing on a book on my criticism.

But it was a good chat. Lots of laughs considering the extreme social horror category of her subject matter. I only asked her half the questions I had prepared because we got so deeply into the Internet as a setting, as inspiration, as a traumatising entity, and as a place that generates endless language for writers to work with. But you really have to overprepare for jobs like this.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>publication date for Chaotic Nightclub Photos - The Review 🍾</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/chaotic-nightclub-photos-out-now/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/chaotic-nightclub-photos-out-now/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Rough Trade Books series on Nightlife is out now, including an essay I wrote about a Twitter account that posts images of chaotic nightclub photography.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;Writing with all the trademark verve and deliciously irreverent brio that de la Puente has become known for as a founder of The White Pube, Chaotic Nightclub Photos: The Review charts one art critic’s voracious appetite for the eponymous Twitter feed and its glut of flashbulb surrealism. Taking the reader back through the history of artistic representations of nightclubs, de la Puente finds herself asking why this chaotic, unhinged energy has so often been found wanting in the cultural depictions of night-time debauchery. Hugely intelligent, readable, personal, playful, and yet full of deft scholarship and deep knowledge, this is a vital contribution to the lore of the growing cult of Chaotic Nightclub Photos.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>on Soho Radio chatting about the club 📡</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/chaotic-nightclub-photos-soho-radio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/chaotic-nightclub-photos-soho-radio/</guid><description>&lt;p>in the run up to the &lt;a href="https://roughtradebooks.com/collections/editions/products/chaotic-nightclub-photos-the-review-gabrielle-de-la-puente-the-white-pube">Chaotic Nightclub Photos: The Review&lt;/a> publication with Rough Trade Books as part of their nightlife series, I did a radio show with Dead Ink Bookshop and &lt;a href="https://roughtradebooks.com/collections/editions/products/deliria-jeff-young">Jeff Young&lt;/a> who is also releasing a pamphlet.
