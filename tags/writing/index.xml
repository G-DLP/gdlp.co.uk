I was invited over to review the residency experience itself, but I also made some time to start a new book. It was a great week, but kinda sad to think about how rare it is, as any sort of maker, to have time and space to do that making. I wrote about the residency and the financial context that artists are currently operating in -&amp;gt;</description></item><item><title>Hardeep Pandhal's Inheritance Quest is out April 30th 🚗</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/inheritance-quest/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/inheritance-quest/</guid><description>first thing&amp;rsquo;s first, the link is here. second thing&amp;rsquo;s second, the link takes you to Black Dog Press&amp;rsquo;s monograph for artist Hardeep Pandhal where I wrote an essay about his video Riddles On Back Street. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually write an essay. When I first sat down to watch it, I was struck by how many video game references it held and I decided to instead write about it in the style of a walkthrough.</description></item><item><title>my Poor Things review has been translated 🧠</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/in-czech/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/in-czech/</guid><description>after I published a review of Poor Things, we got a really nice message from Revue Prostor asking if they could translate the text into Czech for their website.

I watched Unrest and didn&amp;rsquo;t like it at all.
I got a little bored of writing about art-things and reviewed an experience instead.
And for my Culture at Home column, I wrote about Wolf Alice&amp;rsquo;s visual album for Blue Weekend.
And then a little on how meaningful it is to play games at home.</description></item><item><title>My book Poor Artists is coming out October 3rd 🐧</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/poor-artists-announcement/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/poor-artists-announcement/</guid><description>BOOK ANNOUNCEMENT!!!!
On October 3rd 2024, Poor Artists will be published thanks to Penguin&amp;rsquo;s imprint Particular Press in the UK and Prestel in the US.
&amp;lsquo;At a moment in which working as a professional artist is an increasingly unattainable luxury, art criticism duo The White Pube investigate why so many artists try anyway. Labelled “the Diet Prada of the art world” by British Vogue, in Poor Artists writers Gabrielle de la Puente and Zarina Muhammad ridicule a contemporary art world that has turned art into artworks, art schools into art universities, and creative expression into cut-throat competition.</description></item><item><title>The Largest McDonald's in Europe 🦢</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/the-largest-mcdonalds-in-europe/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/the-largest-mcdonalds-in-europe/</guid><description>My first review of 2024 is called The Largest McDonald&amp;rsquo;s in Europe.

The first instalment was on knitting and Lærke Bagger&amp;rsquo;s book Close Knit. The second instalment went up in December, and it was on Photowork&amp;rsquo;s Festival in a Box project. Aaand I just checked back today to see the third text is up now too. The third one is on a Youtuber called shiey who takes himself places he&amp;rsquo;s not supposed to, and posts the evidence online.</description></item><item><title>should more artists rage bait online?</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/discontented/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/discontented/</guid><description>&amp;lsquo;Gabrielle de la Puente talks shitposting on instagram, the weight of digital attention, and the financial allure of being annoying online.&amp;rsquo; that&amp;rsquo;s me baby

Elephant changed hands, the column got cut, and then we got a message from the new team asking if we wanted to pick it back up again. I think we were both dishing out advice. There&amp;rsquo;s only so much we know. So, we had a think about things we would genuinely like to do and I proposed an individual column about Culture at Home.</description></item><item><title>my first review in a while ✍🏻</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/maggot-man/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/maggot-man/</guid><description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t write any reviews over the summer because I had to write a 2nd draft of the book I am working on with ZM, but critic-me is back momentarily, and I can very much feel the effect of writing on a book on my criticism. My latest text is a roundabout review written from the perspective of an artist called Cody Senn. In my text, he&amp;rsquo;s called The Maggot Man.</description></item><item><title>rough trade convo at the handyman ✅</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/chaotic-nightclub-photos-dead-ink/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/chaotic-nightclub-photos-dead-ink/</guid><description>last night, I headed to the Handyman for a panel talk arranged by Rough Trade Books and the nearby Dead Ink Bookshop to talk to Jeff Young, Jim Quail, and Will Burns about the nightlife series I&amp;rsquo;m a part of*

I&amp;rsquo;ve asked the event hosts Dead Ink Bookshop to make the recording available, and I&amp;rsquo;ll link that here once it&amp;rsquo;s up. But it was a good chat. Lots of laughs considering the extreme social horror category of her subject matter. I only asked her half the questions I had prepared because we got so deeply into the Internet as a setting, as inspiration, as a traumatising entity, and as a place that generates endless language for writers to work with.</description></item><item><title>publication date for Chaotic Nightclub Photos - The Review 🍾</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/chaotic-nightclub-photos-out-now/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/chaotic-nightclub-photos-out-now/</guid><description>The Rough Trade Books series on Nightlife is out now, including an essay I wrote about a Twitter account that posts images of chaotic nightclub photography.

&amp;lsquo;Writing with all the trademark verve and deliciously irreverent brio that de la Puente has become known for as a founder of The White Pube, Chaotic Nightclub Photos: The Review charts one art critic’s voracious appetite for the eponymous Twitter feed and its glut of flashbulb surrealism.</description></item><item><title>on Soho Radio chatting about the club 📡</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/chaotic-nightclub-photos-soho-radio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/chaotic-nightclub-photos-soho-radio/</guid><description>in the run up to the Chaotic Nightclub Photos: The Review publication with Rough Trade Books as part of their nightlife series, I did a radio show with Dead Ink Bookshop and Jeff Young who is also releasing a pamphlet.

I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time to write it but I had fun. And then after I&amp;rsquo;d had my fun, Rough Trade Books got in touch asking if I would like to write a longer version as a part of their upcoming nightlife series. Yes pleaseee. More time to figure out what I wanted to say, more opportunity to put Gossip and Art History in there.</description></item><item><title>wrote another short story ooOoo</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/the-bingo-review/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/the-bingo-review/</guid><description>okay, I&amp;rsquo;m on a roll, wrote another short story/review.
