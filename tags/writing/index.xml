The first instalment was on knitting and Lærke Bagger&amp;rsquo;s book Close Knit. The second instalment went up in December, and it was on Photowork&amp;rsquo;s Festival in a Box project. Aaand I just checked back today to see the third text is up now too. The third one is on a Youtuber called shiey who takes himself places he&amp;rsquo;s not supposed to, and posts the evidence online.</description></item><item><title>should more artists rage bait online?</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/discontented/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/discontented/</guid><description>&amp;lsquo;Gabrielle de la Puente talks shitposting on instagram, the weight of digital attention, and the financial allure of being annoying online.&amp;rsquo; that&amp;rsquo;s me baby

Elephant changed hands, the column got cut, and then we got a message from the new team asking if we wanted to pick it back up again. I think we were both dishing out advice. There&amp;rsquo;s only so much we know. So, we had a think about things we would genuinely like to do and I proposed an individual column about Culture at Home.</description></item><item><title>my first review in a while ✍🏻</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/maggot-man/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/maggot-man/</guid><description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t write any reviews over the summer because I had to write a 2nd draft of the book I am working on with ZM, but critic-me is back momentarily, and I can very much feel the effect of writing on a book on my criticism. My latest text is a roundabout review written from the perspective of an artist called Cody Senn. In my text, he&amp;rsquo;s called The Maggot Man.</description></item><item><title>rough trade convo at the handyman ✅</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/chaotic-nightclub-photos-dead-ink/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/chaotic-nightclub-photos-dead-ink/</guid><description>last night, I headed to the Handyman for a panel talk arranged by Rough Trade Books and the nearby Dead Ink Bookshop to talk to Jeff Young, Jim Quail, and Will Burns about the nightlife series I&amp;rsquo;m a part of*

I&amp;rsquo;ve asked the event hosts Dead Ink Bookshop to make the recording available, and I&amp;rsquo;ll link that here once it&amp;rsquo;s up. But it was a good chat. Lots of laughs considering the extreme social horror category of her subject matter. I only asked her half the questions I had prepared because we got so deeply into the Internet as a setting, as inspiration, as a traumatising entity, and as a place that generates endless language for writers to work with.</description></item><item><title>publication date for Chaotic Nightclub Photos - The Review 🍾</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/chaotic-nightclub-photos-out-now/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/chaotic-nightclub-photos-out-now/</guid><description>The Rough Trade Books series on Nightlife is out now, including an essay I wrote about a Twitter account that posts images of chaotic nightclub photography.

&amp;lsquo;Writing with all the trademark verve and deliciously irreverent brio that de la Puente has become known for as a founder of The White Pube, Chaotic Nightclub Photos: The Review charts one art critic’s voracious appetite for the eponymous Twitter feed and its glut of flashbulb surrealism.</description></item><item><title>on Soho Radio chatting about the club 📡</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/chaotic-nightclub-photos-soho-radio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/chaotic-nightclub-photos-soho-radio/</guid><description>in the run up to the Chaotic Nightclub Photos: The Review publication with Rough Trade Books as part of their nightlife series, I did a radio show with Dead Ink Bookshop and Jeff Young who is also releasing a pamphlet.

We both do readings of our work and we also play songs we associate with the night. Jeff&amp;rsquo;s songs are also better.</description></item><item><title>In conversation with Alison Rumfitt this autumn</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/alison-rumfitt/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/alison-rumfitt/</guid><description>On October 18th, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be in convo with Alison Rumfitt in the Handyman here in Liverpool, for an event produced by Dead Ink Bookshop.

I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time to write it but I had fun. And then after I&amp;rsquo;d had my fun, Rough Trade Books got in touch asking if I would like to write a longer version as a part of their upcoming nightlife series. Yes pleaseee. More time to figure out what I wanted to say, more opportunity to put Gossip and Art History in there.</description></item><item><title>wrote another short story ooOoo</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/the-bingo-review/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/the-bingo-review/</guid><description>okay, I&amp;rsquo;m on a roll, wrote another short story/review.

I don&amp;rsquo;t normally post about my TWP texts here on my personal site but I like the idea that someone coming to my site on a professional basis ends up reading the bingo review and thinking I&amp;rsquo;m mad
