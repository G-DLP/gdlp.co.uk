&amp;lsquo;Writing with all the trademark verve and deliciously irreverent brio that de la Puente has become known for as a founder of The White Pube, Chaotic Nightclub Photos: The Review charts one art critic’s voracious appetite for the eponymous Twitter feed and its glut of flashbulb surrealism.</description></item><item><title>on Soho Radio chatting about the club 📡</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/chaotic-nightclub-photos-soho-radio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/chaotic-nightclub-photos-soho-radio/</guid><description>in the run up to the Chaotic Nightclub Photos: The Review publication with Rough Trade Books as part of their nightlife series, I did a radio show with Dead Ink Bookshop and Jeff Young who is also releasing a pamphlet. His is better than mine.

We both do readings of our work and we also play songs we associate with the night. Jeff&amp;rsquo;s songs are also better.</description></item><item><title>In conversation with Alison Rumfitt this autumn</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/alison-rumfitt/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/alison-rumfitt/</guid><description>On October 18th, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be in convo with Alison Rumfitt in the Handyman here in Liverpool, for an event produced by Dead Ink Bookshop.

I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time to write it but I had fun. And then after I&amp;rsquo;d had my fun, Rough Trade Books got in touch asking if I would like to write a longer version as a part of their upcoming nightlife series. Yes pleaseee. More time to figure out what I wanted to say, more opportunity to put Gossip and Art History in there.</description></item><item><title>wrote another short story ooOoo</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/the-bingo-review/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/the-bingo-review/</guid><description>okay, I&amp;rsquo;m on a roll, wrote another short story/review.

I don&amp;rsquo;t normally post about my TWP texts here on my personal site but I like the idea that someone coming to my site on a professional basis ends up reading the bingo review and thinking I&amp;rsquo;m mad

I&amp;rsquo;m not even close to where I was energy-wise but I am doing more. Make of that what you will. One of those doing-more-things involved writing a bizarro short story over 3 afternoons. I am just&amp;hellip; a little bit sick of reality, I guess. Little bit sick of sincerity.</description></item></channel></rss>
