I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time to write it but I had fun. And then after I&amp;rsquo;d had my fun, Rough Trade Books got in touch asking if I would like to write a longer version as a part of their upcoming nightlife series. Yes pleaseee. More time to figure out what I wanted to say, more opportunity to put Gossip and Art History in there.</description></item><item><title>wrote another short story ooOoo</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/the-bingo-review/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/the-bingo-review/</guid><description>okay, I&amp;rsquo;m on a roll, wrote another short story/review.

I&amp;rsquo;m not even close to where I was energy-wise but I am doing more. Make of that what you will. One of those doing-more-things involved writing a bizarro short story over 3 afternoons. I am just&amp;hellip; a little bit sick of reality, I guess. Little bit sick of sincerity.</description></item></channel></rss>
