I am very glad Elden Ring won. Chaotic choice in the eyes of some people, but I think it was doing the most to advance the multiplayer genre. &amp;lsquo;You need help and you can have help but only at great, finicky, risky cost&amp;rsquo; was so in keeping with the game&amp;rsquo;s narrative and challenge level. I was including the gamer-to-gamer peer-to-peer world that exists outside of a game, as well as the co-op that happens inside, and there&amp;rsquo;s no way I could have come to enjoy Elden Ring as much as I did without the player-built knowledge base around it. And I love that!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>taught on Game Studies 🧩</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/game-studies/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/game-studies/</guid><description>&lt;p>In terms of teaching, I&amp;rsquo;ve only ever done lectures and tutorials for art students, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been winging it this entire time (winging it might be harsh, but lecturing on my work as the white pube feels innately like a fluke). So, it was nice to be excited down to Leeds Beckett to teach on Game Studies, and for it to not be a lecture but an actual 2.5 hour lesson. I invited students to reflect on the culture they enjoy in their day to day life, to zoom out and think about what their enjoyment of it means, or fulfills. We looked at the inverse too. The group then worked backwards, thinking about how they felt about life right now, in general or personally. What kind of game mechanics would they design to compliment or alleviate the way they&amp;rsquo;re feeling? How can they give themselves the culture they need, &lt;em>or&lt;/em> how can they bear this in mind later to project the same considerations onto game design to invite players into a certain emotional or social state?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>youtuber? ha ha ha</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/youtube/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/youtube/</guid><description>&lt;p>I spend so much time on youtube because i am on a friend&amp;rsquo;s premium plan, and I recently decided I should convert some content from The White Pube (which has been exclusively written + audio for years) into videos. Everyone loves videos. The algorithm loves videos. I love videos. So I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing things like this &amp;gt;&lt;/p>

Tour de Moon got in touch to ask if we could find 4 young game developers under the age of 25. They wanted to commission people to make games that responded to typical game tropes, and they also had to use the zany aesthetic of the wider festival. Neon, marble effects, big shapes, abstract settings. I got in touch with a few universities, spread the word on Twitter, and trawled through all the Discord servers I&amp;rsquo;m on to find people. I&amp;rsquo;m 27 but it turns out everyone I know is older than me, not younger. I eventually found 4 game devs who fit the bill though. You can find info about their work below. I stuck around after the selection process to offer critical support as the games were in development, playing WIP builds and making sure everything stuck to the brief. It was fun. And I&amp;rsquo;m writing it here because honestly I would like to do more work like this in the future hint hint&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>a beautiful staircase ✨</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/a-beautiful-staircase/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/a-beautiful-staircase/</guid><description>&lt;p>deets:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Community Radio Tbilisi presents a monthly radio show A Beautiful Staircase in an Abandoned Building (ABSAB) by Ben Tupper, that explores the soundtracks of video games across various genres and console platforms. Each month, ABSAB features cuts of video game soundtracks curated around various cultural themes and selected by a guest artist with an affiliation for or working within video game culture. Video game soundtracks can be particularly unique in how they generate associations between memory, space and affect. With these associations in mind, ABSAB aims to provide a platform where guests and listeners can use the collected musical fragments of virtual worlds to explore the ‘real’ phenomena of our material world.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Haven of Aves 🦢</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/the-haven-of-aves/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/the-haven-of-aves/</guid><description>&lt;p>Earlier this year, David Blandy invited me to write a supplement for his TTRPG series Lost Eons.

It was really helpful for me to write about being sick in order to process everything and make peace with it (if making peace is even possible). But I also resented writing about sickness, even when I felt the need to, because I hated how it would get stuck in my throat. Sometimes I’d start writing, find myself going off on a tangent about Covid, fight with the text, and then just give up and let it be loud like it wants to. Other times though, I managed to keep it quiet. Sometimes, I managed to write about something without giving Covid the airtime, and those happen to be my favourite texts of 2021.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
