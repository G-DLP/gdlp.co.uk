Community Radio Tbilisi presents a monthly radio show A Beautiful Staircase in an Abandoned Building (ABSAB) by Ben Tupper, that explores the soundtracks of video games across various genres and console platforms. Each month, ABSAB features cuts of video game soundtracks curated around various cultural themes and selected by a guest artist with an affiliation for or working within video game culture. Video game soundtracks can be particularly unique in how they generate associations between memory, space and affect.</description></item><item><title>The Haven of Aves ü¶¢</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/the-haven-of-aves/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/the-haven-of-aves/</guid><description>Earlier this year, David Blandy invited me to write a supplement for his TTRPG series Lost Eons.

Working with students at the Liverpool School of Art and Design at Liverpool John Moores University, Gabrielle de la Puente and David Blandy have created a future vision of Liverpool after climate collapse, that eerily echoes our own.</description></item><item><title>my favourite texts of 2021 ‚≠êÔ∏è</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/best-of-2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/best-of-2021/</guid><description>My first full year writing game reviews was a weird one - deeply concentrated on games, still understanding what they are and what they can do, all the while deep in my feelings becoming housebound from Long Covid. It was really helpful for me to write about being sick in order to process everything and make peace with it (if making peace is even possible).
