I re-read what I said and I thought &amp;lsquo;wow, that&amp;rsquo;s dramatic&amp;rsquo; and then stopped and realised how dramatic this whole thing really is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;Since long-haul COVID left Gabrielle housebound, sometimes she finds herself wanting only to talk to other chronically ill people. “They’re the only people that get it,” the 27-year-old says. Her life — once so expansive, full of work, travel, and plans to learn to drive a car and visit new countries — has shrunk. Now she only has the energy to deal with the present. “I can’t see what’s happening tomorrow or next week or a few years down the line. I can’t see if I’ll ever have kids because I can’t fully look after myself anymore. Everything feels futureless. And I think that futureless-ness is hard for people who aren’t sick to understand.”&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Long Covid is actually POTS?</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/long-covid-pots/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/long-covid-pots/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few weeks ago, I had an appointment with the Long Covid Clinic in Liverpool (that has recently changed hands, moving from Aintree hospital to a health centre in Speke). I described all the symptoms I’d been going through for the past year and the doctor said it sounds very much like I fall into the dysautonomic phenotype when it comes to Long Covid - - like the virus has messed up by autonomic nervous system and that’s why I &amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>long covid treatment in Liverpool [UPDATED] 💀</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/long-covid-liverpool/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/long-covid-liverpool/</guid><description>&lt;p>I thought it would be good to keep track of how I have (and haven’t) received support for Long Covid in Liverpool. By good I mean useful for other people in the same position. By good I also maybe mean an interesting document for people with other post viral illnesses who are looking at the reaction to Long Covid and feeling some type of way. So, this is my shitty timeline. And this is why I have lost faith in health professionals, or rather, the terribly organised structure that these health professionals work inside the NHS.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Real Review 📚</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/real-review/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/real-review/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was invited to write about Long Covid for the Spring 2021 edition of Real Review. It was exciting because the Pope wrote something in the issue before me. I decided to look at all my symptoms, and reflect on how much my life had changed. It was the first time I&amp;rsquo;d sat down to write about LC and LC only, and it killed me to do so. At first, I actually regretted writing this because I haaaadn&amp;rsquo;t quite wanted to deal with how big of a change this had been for me. But looking back, I&amp;rsquo;m glad it&amp;rsquo;s there. I&amp;rsquo;m glad I have these different bits of writing to track the year so far. Even if I have better words now, I have the first words there too, recorded, naive and sad. Anyway, here is the link and here&amp;rsquo;s a picture of the issue too. I was due to be in the summer issue but they wanted to bring my text forward (nice) except because it was a last minute change, my name accidentally got left off the list of authors on the back (bad) so you just gotta believe I&amp;rsquo;m in there lol.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
