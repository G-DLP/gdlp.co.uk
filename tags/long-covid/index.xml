I re-read what I said and I thought &amp;lsquo;wow, that&amp;rsquo;s dramatic&amp;rsquo; and then stopped and realised how dramatic this whole thing really is.
&amp;lsquo;Since long-haul COVID left Gabrielle housebound, sometimes she finds herself wanting only to talk to other chronically ill people. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre the only people that get it,‚Äù the 27-year-old says. Her life ‚Äî once so expansive, full of work, travel, and plans to learn to drive a car and visit new countries ‚Äî has shrunk.</description></item><item><title>My Long Covid is actually POTS?</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/long-covid-pots/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/long-covid-pots/</guid><description>A few weeks ago, I had an appointment with the Long Covid Clinic in Liverpool (that has recently changed hands, moving from Aintree hospital to a health centre in Speke).
