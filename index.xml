I am very glad Elden Ring won. Chaotic choice in the eyes of some people, but I think it was doing the most to advance the multiplayer genre. &amp;lsquo;You need help and you can have help but only at great, finicky, risky cost&amp;rsquo; was so in keeping with the game&amp;rsquo;s narrative and challenge level. I was including the gamer-to-gamer peer-to-peer world that exists outside of a game, as well as the co-op that happens inside, and there&amp;rsquo;s no way I could have come to enjoy Elden Ring as much as I did without the player-built knowledge base around it.</description></item><item><title>A text for Adonis Archontides 📚</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/sensing-is-believing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/sensing-is-believing/</guid><description>A text I wrote in 2022 is finally out! The piece responded to Adonis Archontides&amp;rsquo;s artwork &amp;lsquo;Sensing is believing, believing is seeing&amp;rsquo; which was exhibited at the Nicosia Municipal Arts Centre in Cyrpus. The text is printed in booklets that open up into posters, so if you are lucky enough to pick one up in Cyprus, I hope you enjoy :)

We don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip; do fashion. But the event was like a massive exhibition. 10(??)

It&amp;rsquo;s our first official live-in residency in 7 years. We&amp;rsquo;re here for 16 whole days. It&amp;rsquo;s been very, very productive so far.
We&amp;rsquo;re writing a book at the moment, which is something I cannot speak about in earnest because of other people&amp;rsquo;s marketing timelines. But that is why we are here. Director Miguel Amado, who we&amp;rsquo;ve known for years now, got in touch to ask if there was any way Sirius might be able to support us at the moment &amp;ndash; not knowing about the book panic we were feeling.</description></item><item><title>A-N Assembly on Access</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/a-n-assembly/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/a-n-assembly/</guid><description>At the weekend, I was part of A-N&amp;rsquo;s Assembly Leicester weekender that focused on disability rights, DIY activism and working in the arts.

I am a writer.
I co-run The White Pube with Zarina Muhammad where we publish criticism on art, video games, films, books, theatre and all the culture that gets on our nerves (for better or worse). We publish reviews in text, audio and video.
We also run a Successful Funding Application Library and a Working Class Creatives Grant. We think broadly about how we can make a better art world for everybody (one that is fair, accessible, and a lot more affordable).</description></item><item><title>worked on a games project 🎮</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/moon-games/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/moon-games/</guid><description>99% of my work involves writing but every so often I get to work in a curatorial capacity. Tour de Moon got in touch to ask if we could find 4 young game developers under the age of 25. They wanted to commission people to make games that responded to typical game tropes, and they also had to use the zany aesthetic of the wider festival. Neon, marble effects, big shapes, abstract settings.</description></item><item><title>spoke to Teen Vogue about Long Covid</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/teen-vogue/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/teen-vogue/</guid><description>i spoke to Teen Vogue about Long Covid. I re-read what I said and I thought &amp;lsquo;wow, that&amp;rsquo;s dramatic&amp;rsquo; and then stopped and realised how dramatic this whole thing really is.
&amp;lsquo;Since long-haul COVID left Gabrielle housebound, sometimes she finds herself wanting only to talk to other chronically ill people. “They’re the only people that get it,” the 27-year-old says. Her life — once so expansive, full of work, travel, and plans to learn to drive a car and visit new countries — has shrunk.</description></item><item><title>My Long Covid is actually POTS?</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/long-covid-pots/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/long-covid-pots/</guid><description>A few weeks ago, I had an appointment with the Long Covid Clinic in Liverpool (that has recently changed hands, moving from Aintree hospital to a health centre in Speke).

Community Radio Tbilisi presents a monthly radio show A Beautiful Staircase in an Abandoned Building (ABSAB) by Ben Tupper, that explores the soundtracks of video games across various genres and console platforms. Each month, ABSAB features cuts of video game soundtracks curated around various cultural themes and selected by a guest artist with an affiliation for or working within video game culture. Video game soundtracks can be particularly unique in how they generate associations between memory, space and affect.</description></item><item><title>long covid treatment in Liverpool [UPDATED] 💀</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/long-covid-liverpool/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/long-covid-liverpool/</guid><description>I thought it would be good to keep track of how I have (and haven’t) received support for Long Covid in Liverpool.

It was really helpful for me to write about being sick in order to process everything and make peace with it (if making peace is even possible). But I also resented writing about sickness, even when I felt the need to, because I hated how it would get stuck in my throat.</description></item><item><title>Real Review 📚</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/real-review/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/real-review/</guid><description>I was invited to write about Long Covid for the Spring 2021 edition of Real Review.
