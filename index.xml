Photoworks invited me to be on a panel for the 2024 annual summit about access in art festivals, but instead of getting loads of trains to Brighton or Zooming in, I asked if I could submit a photo. I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking lots of film photos over the past year and there was one on my mind, of the mold on my bathroom ceiling. After starting my Culture at Home column on Elephant, I thought it was funny to see that in terms of another kind of culture.</description></item><item><title>recent writing I'm proud of ‚úçüèª</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/recent-writing-mar-24/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/recent-writing-mar-24/</guid><description>I wrote a review of Poor Things &amp;ndash; the Alasdair Gray Archive said it was their favourite text about the film so far!
I watched Unrest and didn&amp;rsquo;t like it at all.
I got a little bored of writing about art-things and reviewed an experience instead.
And for my Culture at Home column, I wrote about Wolf Alice&amp;rsquo;s visual album for Blue Weekend.

On October 3rd 2024, Poor Artists will be published thanks to Penguin&amp;rsquo;s imprint Particular Press in the UK and Prestel in the US.
&amp;lsquo;At a moment in which working as a professional artist is an increasingly unattainable luxury, art criticism duo The White Pube investigate why so many artists try anyway. Labelled ‚Äúthe Diet Prada of the art world‚Äù by British Vogue, in Poor Artists writers Gabrielle de la Puente and Zarina Muhammad ridicule a contemporary art world that has turned art into artworks, art schools into art universities, and creative expression into cut-throat competition.</description></item><item><title>made another Downpour-thing ‚òîÔ∏è</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/tejidos/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/tejidos/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been knitting for almost a year and I basically knit every day now.

I was including the gamer-to-gamer peer-to-peer world that exists outside of a game, as well as the co-op that happens inside, and there&amp;rsquo;s no way I could have come to enjoy Elden Ring as much as I did without the player-built knowledge base around it.</description></item><item><title>A text for Adonis Archontides üìö</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/sensing-is-believing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/sensing-is-believing/</guid><description>A text I wrote in 2022 is finally out!

(man I&amp;rsquo;m so tired i can&amp;rsquo;t remember) co-created collections were revealed for London Fashion Week in the form of installations rather than catwalk shows.</description></item><item><title>a week in the life of a critic ‚úàÔ∏è</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/critic/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/critic/</guid><description>went to london for a week:</description></item><item><title>Kunstkritikk interview The White Pube ü´Ç</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/kunstkritikk/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/kunstkritikk/</guid><description>As The White Pube, we haven&amp;rsquo;t done a Big Proper Official interview in a while. To be honest, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything new to say. Everything already existed in tweets and reviews and whatnot, so we turned them down for a while. Now felt like a good time to reintroduce ourselves through a very measured interview with the Norweigan publication Kunstkritikk. You can read the piece here in English or Norweigan.</description></item><item><title>liverpool day out üì∏</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/liverpool-adventure/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/liverpool-adventure/</guid><description>this was fun to make:</description></item><item><title>come to ireland with me ‚úàÔ∏è</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/cobh-film/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/cobh-film/</guid><description>what i got up to in dec 2023:

It&amp;rsquo;s our first official live-in residency in 7 years. We&amp;rsquo;re here for 16 whole days. It&amp;rsquo;s been very, very productive so far.
We&amp;rsquo;re writing a book at the moment, which is something I cannot speak about in earnest because of other people&amp;rsquo;s marketing timelines. But that is why we are here. Director Miguel Amado, who we&amp;rsquo;ve known for years now, got in touch to ask if there was any way Sirius might be able to support us at the moment &amp;ndash; not knowing about the book panic we were feeling.</description></item><item><title>A-N Assembly on Access</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/a-n-assembly/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/a-n-assembly/</guid><description>At the weekend, I was part of A-N&amp;rsquo;s Assembly Leicester weekender that focused on disability rights, DIY activism and working in the arts.

I spoke on a panel titled &amp;lsquo;On Locality and Access in the Arts&amp;rsquo; alongside Ashok Mistry and chaired by Gino Atwood, discussing online localities, centralised social media, and the limits of digital activism.</description></item><item><title>Juror on John Moores Painting Prize 2023</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/john-moores-painting-prize-2023/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/john-moores-painting-prize-2023/</guid><description>Very excited to be a juror on next year&amp;rsquo;s John Moores Painting Prize alongside Yu Hong, Claudette Johnson, Chila Kumari Singh Burman &amp;amp; Alexis Harding.

Tour de Moon got in touch to ask if we could find 4 young game developers under the age of 25.

Neon, marble effects, big shapes, abstract settings.</description></item><item><title>spoke to Teen Vogue about Long Covid</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/teen-vogue/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/teen-vogue/</guid><description>i spoke to Teen Vogue about Long Covid.

Each month, ABSAB features cuts of video game soundtracks curated around various cultural themes and selected by a guest artist with an affiliation for or working within video game culture. Video game soundtracks can be particularly unique in how they generate associations between memory, space and affect.</description></item><item><title>long covid treatment in Liverpool [UPDATED] üíÄ</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/long-covid-liverpool/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/long-covid-liverpool/</guid><description>I thought it would be good to keep track of how I have (and haven‚Äôt) received support for Long Covid in Liverpool.

Working with students at the Liverpool School of Art and Design at Liverpool John Moores University, Gabrielle de la Puente and David Blandy have created a future vision of Liverpool after climate collapse, that eerily echoes our own.</description></item><item><title>my favourite texts of 2021 ‚≠êÔ∏è</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/best-of-2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/best-of-2021/</guid><description>My first full year writing game reviews was a weird one - deeply concentrated on games, still understanding what they are and what they can do, all the while deep in my feelings becoming housebound from Long Covid. It was really helpful for me to write about being sick in order to process everything and make peace with it (if making peace is even possible). But I also resented writing about sickness, even when I felt the need to, because I hated how it would get stuck in my throat.</description></item><item><title>Real Review üìö</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/real-review/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/real-review/</guid><description>I was invited to write about Long Covid for the Spring 2021 edition of Real Review. It was exciting because the Pope wrote something in the issue before me. I decided to look at all my symptoms, and reflect on how much my life had changed. It was the first time I&amp;rsquo;d sat down to write about LC and LC only, and it killed me to do so. At first, I actually regretted writing this because I haaaadn&amp;rsquo;t quite wanted to deal with how big of a change this had been for me.</description></item><item><title>The Impact of Using Social Media as an Artist üë©üèª‚Äçüíª</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/art-report/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/art-report/</guid><description>Today, I am publishing the biggest thing I‚Äôve ever written.
