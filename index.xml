I am a writer.
(‚úø‚ó†‚Äø‚ó†) üå∏
I co-run The White Pube with Zarina Muhammad. On TWP, I publish criticism on video games and art. Reviews go out in text and we have a podcast for audio versions. We also run a Successful Funding Application Library and a Working Class Writers Grant. We think broadly about how we can make a better art world for everybody (one that is fair, accessible, and affordable).</description></item><item><title>long covid and going nocturnal üåô</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/blog/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/blog/</guid><description>Sometimes I think, oh wait, I shouldn‚Äôt speak so openly about my health on the internet. My enemies will celebrate my bad luck; I might lose out on future jobs if people know I‚Äôm a little weakling nowadays! But I‚Äôve found it really, really tough to follow along with any personal accounts of Long Covid and putting words onto the Internet might help others figure things out for themselves.
The words I want to put down today are about my sleeping pattern.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/blog2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/blog2/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/blog3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/blog3/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/blog4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/blog4/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
