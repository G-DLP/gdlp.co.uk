in the run up to the [Chaotic Nightclub Photos: The Review](https://roughtradebooks.com/collections/editions/products/chaotic-nightclub-photos-the-review-gabrielle-de-la-puente-the-white-pube) publication with Rough Trade Books as part of their nightlife series, I did a radio show with Dead Ink Bookshop and [Jeff Young](https://roughtradebooks.com/collections/editions/products/deliria-jeff-young) who is also releasing a pamphlet. His is better than mine. 

You can listen to the broadcast here:

We both do readings of our work and we also play songs we associate with the night. Jeff's songs are also better. Mine are scarring.
