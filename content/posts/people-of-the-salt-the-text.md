there is a really good food newsletter called Vittles. I love and respect it. last month, I was thinking about how much I _have_ to think about food nowadays, which is something I simply never used to do. Idk what I used to eat. Or drink. I know I never drank water. But then I got Covid and Long Covid and Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome and now all I do is stress about what I am going to eat. So, I sent Vittles an email pitching them on this absolutely ridiculous stress that I never asked for, and they said yes, and then they helped me edit it into what it is today: People of the Salt. Part of their Cooking From Life series. Really good pitching experience, even better editing experience. I continue to rate them so highly lmao. Here is the text! enjoy
