I didn't write any reviews over the summer because I had to write a 2nd draft of the book I am working on with ZM, but critic-me is back momentarily, and I can very much feel the effect of writing on a book on my criticism. My latest text is a roundabout review written from the perspective of an artist called Cody Senn. In my text, he's called The Maggot Man. Some of the information is true, some of it isn't. You can read or listen to it [here](https://thewhitepube.co.uk/art-reviews/maggot-man/).
