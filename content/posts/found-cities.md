I recently chaired an event at Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery on the closing weekend of the Found Cities, Lost Objects: Women in the City exhibition. The panel comprised of Lubaina Himid, Sumaya Kassim, Dawinder Bansal and Selina Thompson. We spoke about existing in this country through a cost of living crisis, surviving in buildings and systems designed without women in mind. The talk was co-produced by BMAG and The WOW Foundation.

I'm writing this blog post to mark it but also to say how much I enjoyed chairing a panel talk after all this wavy pandemic time, and if you are reading this and you are looking for a chair, get in touch because I would love to do it more :)
