on apr 3rd i'll be at Dead Ink Bookshop to talk "GOBLINHOOD: GOBLIN AS A MODE,' an essay and poem collection by Jen Calleja that artfully propound her theory of "Goblin-hood" - taking in all aspects of pop culture from film, literature and art as well as the author's personal and original examinations of grief, lust, family histories and the physical fact of living in the world as it is. Inventive, wild and tricky - a curious, visceral addition to Callejaâ€™s remarkable oeuvre."
