ðŸ“š Ootlin by Jenni Fagan

"These six books... they're the stories that followed us home, demanding to be heard." â€“ Terri White, Chair of Judges

"The winner will be announced on 6 March at Northern Stage in Newcastle, and will receive Â£10,000 and the chance to undertake a writing retreat at Gordon Burn's cottage."

if I got Â£5000 after splitting my winnings with Zarina, I would put it towards an MA in Creative Writing which I know sounds like I'm going backwards if I've already written a book but it's something I want to do and can't afford to because i am a poor artist ha ha 

Looking forward to going to Newcastle though, haven't been in years. And looking forward to reading the rest of the shortlist :)
