this summer, Zarina and I released our first print publication as The White Pube in the form of a pamphlet for Rough Trade Books. It is #10 on their best seller list for 2021 which is cool! 

You can purchase the pamphlet here: https://www.roughtrade.com/gb/the-white-pube/ideas-for-a-new-art-world/pamphlet-plus

'We are The White Pube and this pamphlet collects our ideas for a new art world. The art world is a bit broken. So many problems, such little time. Between January-April 2021, we plastered the distilled thoughts of years of writing on billboards and posters across the UK. We wanted to plop these aphorisms out there, as simple, feasible solutions; almost to prove how easy it can be if change is sincerely sought. The ideas are not radical, and they’re not new. They’re just six Very Good Ideas that we think you should listen to. In this pamphlet, we’ve listed the six ideas and taken the time to explain why we think they are, in fact, Very Good Ideas. There could have been hundreds. Maybe there should have been. But these were the initial ideas for a new art world we went with. We hope they’ll make you think about more Very Good Ideas too.'

If you pick up a copy, thank you very much!!!
