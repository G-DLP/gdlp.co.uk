last night, I headed to the Handyman for a panel talk arranged by Rough Trade Books and the nearby [Dead Ink Bookshop](http://deadinkbookshop.com) to talk to [Jeff Young](https://jeffyoung26.wordpress.com), [Jim Quail](https://www.wearedorothy.com), and Will Burns about the nightlife series I'm a part of*

*I published one of my reviews as a Rough Trade Pamphlet and you can find it [here](https://roughtradebooks.com/collections/editions/products/chaotic-nightclub-photos-the-review-gabrielle-de-la-puente-the-white-pube).

(My energy is so up and down right now, but I'm just trying to hold onto the boom and bust wave and make of it what I can)
