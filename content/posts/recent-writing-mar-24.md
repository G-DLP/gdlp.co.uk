I wrote a review of [Poor Things](https://thewhitepube.co.uk/reviews/2024/poor-things/) -- the Alasdair Gray Archive said it was their favourite text about the film so far!

I watched [Unrest](https://thewhitepube.co.uk/reviews/2024/unrest/) and didn't like it at all.

I got a little bored of writing about art-things and reviewed [an experience](https://thewhitepube.co.uk/reviews/2024/the-floatation-tank/) instead.

And for my Culture at Home column, I wrote about [Wolf Alice's visual album for Blue Weekend](https://elephant.art/wolf-alices-blue-weekend/).

And then a little on [how meaningful it is to play games at home](https://elephant.art/the-grannies-grand-theft-auto-and-third-places/).

Prolific!
