The book came out! I want to kiss every bookseller on the head.

We've done interviews with Alastair Sooke for The Telegraph, Naga Munchetty for BBC Radio Five Live, James Grieg for Dazed, Ben Luke for The Art Newspaper. Readers are sending pictures of it in bookshops across the UK, including the White Cube bookshop loool (someone commented 'the prophecy is fulfilled'). We did a launch at London Review Bookshop, and there are more events to come -- including a trip down to Margate, and one up to Edinburgh for the Radical Book Fair. Man, I just didn't expect to feel this happy. It's been so nice. If you read it and you feel things, please send me an email. I am screenshotting every comment I see about the book and adding it to a folder on my phone so I can hold onto this moment forever : )
