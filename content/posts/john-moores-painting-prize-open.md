Very happy to see the fruit of my labour -- the [John Moores Painting Prize 2023](https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/jmpp/john-moores-painting-prize) is open, after months of jury-ing and 1 afternoon of curation. Please visit! The show is excellent imo. It was a dream come true to be involved, and the resulting show is great thanks to the imaginations and persistence of the artists selected. Met a lot of them at the opening last week! It was a really, really nice time. It is the most difficult job I have done up until this point (when the book is published, that title will transfer). 

The exhibition is definitely about the artists and not about me, but this is my website, and it is the most appropriate place to put pictures of me at work, so here's three of them:

i can't believe my john moores jurying is memorialised with the worst hair colour I've tried so far ha ha ha
