every other sunday, I post a review on [thewhitepube.com](https://thewhitepube.co.uk/); every _other_ sunday, Zarina does. Here's all the things I wrote about in 2025, which definitely didn't end up being every other sunday due very poor health at the start of the year, and then a summer spent writing a book with Z that should be out winter '26 with Particular Books/Penguin Random House. Stay tuned : ) 

The subjects also follow my health, beginning with books, and then moving into live events as the year progresses:

I'm happy with my writing but I realised towards the end of the year how much I miss quick texts. 1000 words, 1500. I'm going to carry on with that in 2026. It's also a bit practical. I need to focus on other work (spent the last 2 weeks on a funding application for example). Grateful to have our audience on the website and Discord so that this reading lands somewhere. Grateful to have writing be the centre of my world 🤝
