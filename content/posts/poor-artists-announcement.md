BOOK ANNOUNCEMENT!!!! 

On October 3rd 2024, **Poor Artists** will be published thanks to Penguin's imprint Particular Press in the UK and Prestel in the US. 

_'At a moment in which working as a professional artist is an increasingly unattainable luxury, art criticism duo The White Pube investigate why so many artists try anyway. Labelled ‚Äúthe Diet Prada of the art world‚Äù by British Vogue, in Poor Artists writers Gabrielle de la Puente and Zarina Muhammad ridicule a contemporary art world that has turned art into artworks, art schools into art universities, and creative expression into cut-throat competition._

_Poor Artists follows aspiring artist Quest Talukdar as she embarks on a surreal journey into the creative industry, where she must decide whether she cares more about success or staying true to herself. Featuring dialogue from anonymous interviews with real people who have all had to ask themselves the same question ‚Äì including a Turner Prize winner or two, a recluse, a Venice Biennale fraudster, a communist messiah, a ghost, and a literal knight ‚Äì The White Pube tell the story of art like never before.'_
