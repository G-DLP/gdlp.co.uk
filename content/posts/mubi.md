I wanted to nip onto my personal site to share that The White Pube is doing a brief partnership with Mubi to promote the release of the African Desperate by Martine Syms. We are producing a review, social media posts, a podcast discussion in audio+video & we are also offering our readers [30 days of mubi for free](https://mubi.com/promos/thewhitepube?utm_source=thewhitepube&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=africandesperate). I'm a big fan of Mubi so I'm really happy about it and I'm sharing it here to celebrate :)
