While Zarina is out doing press for our book Poor Artists IRL at festivals (latitude! edinburgh international book festival!) I'm taking care of the online stuff. Plaster have a podcast called Give Me A Break, discussing people's entry into the arts. I was interviewed by Harriet Lloyd-Smith and ye sure it was probably supposed to a chance to talk about Poor Artists but I accidentally gave my life story instead. I remember it being very funny to record so hopefully it's a funny listen :-)
