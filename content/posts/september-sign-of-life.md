I was enjoying keeping track of all my work on this website but I stopped updating for a few months because my chronic illness (POTS) is much worse in summer, so I've been doing other things instead like: lying in bed and knitting and trying not to vomit and getting a kitten and _knowing_ my book is coming out in October but not really _feeling_ like somebody whose debut is coming out in October because I've just been lying in bed and knitting etc. But here it is. I got a delivery of the US version this week. Here's a picture of the book alongside some of that knitting _and_ some of that kitten:

A nice thing that's been happening over this summer sick time is that a few testimonials have come in from people who have read the book already. Natalie Olah said it was 'a landmark for art writing.' Legacy Russell said it was 'an indispensable read.' Travis Alabanza said 'I was surprised, challenged and affirmed - everything I love in a book.' And Daisy Hildyard said 'This book might change the way you look at art' :)
