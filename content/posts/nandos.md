I just posted the special edition of The White Pube podcast that we made in partnership with Nando's. You can listen or read the transcription [here](http://thewhitepube.co.uk/podcasts/nandos/). It was a great and also genuinely surprising and uplifting week learning more about the company invests in Southern African art -- art, something no one in the world can truly expect a return on investment from. It's support for support's sake. It's mad? and good? And just not what I expected at all. We interview 3 artists who have worked with them -- Nkosinathi Quwe, Colijn Strydom, and Viven Kohler -- who were all brought over to exhibit at 154 art fair. The artists were thoughtful, the Nando's team were fun. I really enjoyed putting this episode together and I hope you enjoy! ðŸŒ¶
