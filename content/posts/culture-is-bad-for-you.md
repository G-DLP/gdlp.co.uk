on march 27th, I will be joining Orian Brook, Dave O'Brien and Mark Taylor at Blackwell's in Manchester to discuss the updated version of their book Culture is Bad for You. You can book a ticket for the event [here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/culture-is-bad-for-you-orian-brook-dave-obrien-and-mark-taylor-tickets-1219322439239?aff=ebdsoporgprofile). This all came about because at the end of 2024, after being on a panel with Orian for Edinburgh's Radical Book Fair, I posted a text about [how much money I have earned as a writer since I began in 2015](https://thewhitepube.co.uk/texts/2024/culture-is-bad-for-you/). Citing their book, which discusses the changing scale of the middle class, and their ever-growing dominion in art, I finally had the data to explain why this industry makes me feel like a tiny rat begging for scraps. I look forward to hashing it out in Manchester. Hopefully see you there
