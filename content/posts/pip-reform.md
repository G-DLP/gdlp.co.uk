My current health crash has coincided with the big 5 year Covid-in-the-UK anniversary _and_ with the Labour government's new eugenic campaign. So I have been giving quotes to people, then reading them back thinking 'I should have been meaner about all of this.' 

1. [I spoke to Creative Review about about the impact of Long Covid on the creative industry](https://www.creativereview.co.uk/long-covid-creatives-coping-pandemic/)

2. [I spoke to James Grieg for Dazed about how Labour's benefit cuts will impact disabled artists](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/66440/1/how-labours-benefits-cuts-will-impact-disabled-artists-welfare-universal-credit?utm_source=Link&utm_medium=Link&utm_campaign=RSSFeed&utm_term=how-labour-s-benefits-cuts-will-impact-disabled-artists)

3. [And then I spoke to Mariana Lemos for Frieze about more of that Labour shit](https://www.frieze.com/article/uk-welfare-cuts-will-harm-disabled-artists-opinion-2025)

I was explaining the welfare reforms to my Spanish teacher earlier today and doing so in a different language made me feel like I was telling lies. I am still waiting on the result of mandatory reconsideration to try to up my PIP from Â£28.70 a week to something that actually has weight. For this to be happening right now is... well, it is not making me feel any better. In Spanish, they call Long Covid 'Covid persistente.' In England where we have to work _because they're called the labour party so everyone has to buck up and work, even if working makes you sicker and sicker and sicker, until you seize, and then cease to be_, it is going to be Covid permanente for us all.
