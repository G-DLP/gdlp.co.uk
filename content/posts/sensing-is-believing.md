A text I wrote in 2022 is finally out! The piece responded to [Adonis Archontides](https://ragnanox.com)'s artwork '[Sensing is believing, believing is seeing](https://ragnanox.itch.io/sensing-is-believing-believing-is-seeing)' which was exhibited at the Nicosia Municipal Arts Centre in Cyrpus. The text is printed in booklets that open up into posters, so if you are lucky enough to pick one up in Cyprus, I hope you enjoy :)
