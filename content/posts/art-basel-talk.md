on tue 7 march I was on a panel talk titled 'Group Crit: On the Form and Function of Meme Making' alongside Hilde Lynn Helphenstein (aka @jerrygogosian) and Cem A. (aka @freezemagazine). The talk was chaired by Karim Sultan, and curated by Stephanie Bailey. I'm really grateful to Stephanie for bringing us together
