first thing's first, the link is [here](https://blackdogonline.com/products/hardeep-pandhal-inheritance-quest). second thing's second, the link takes you to Black Dog Press's monograph for artist Hardeep Pandhal where I wrote an essay about his video Riddles On Back Street. But I didn't actually write an essay. When I first sat down to watch it, I was struck by how many video game references it held and I decided to instead write about it in the style of a walkthrough. It was a lot of fun. Made me want walkthroughs instead of press releases for all artworks. I'll leave the piece I wrote about below, and hopefully it encourages you to pick up the monograph. I am such a Hardeep fan. I have been to exhibitions of us in Berwick, New York, Birmingham, London. Meant a lot to get to write about the magic density of his art.
