_continuously updating this blog since 29th may 2025_

I usually post work updates on this website but I wanted to share my experience of doing the [CHOP Protocol](https://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/pdf/CHOP_Modified_Dallas_POTS_Exercise_Program.pdf) somewhere, because whilst there are a few videos online, I struggled to find complete blogs that didn’t taper off after a few months. Also, my doctors don’t know what it is and maybe yours don’t either. _I will return to this page each month to share an update for anyone interested._

My starting point is that: I got sick with Long Covid January 2021, housebound for half a year, diagnosed with POTS January 2022 and had some help from beta blockers until a Covid reinfection in spring 2023 fucked me up even more. 2023-2025 was spent in an unending arm wrestle with fatigue, every single POTS symptom on the list, and Vasovagal syndrome. I really tried to do stuff but my body really didn’t want me to. Then, in April 2025, my cardiologist started me on Midodrine and it felt so much easier to be in my body all of a sudden. I wanted to try building some stamina back up.

Obviously I don’t know if I will be able to, or if post-exertional malaise will put its foot down. But YouTube fatefully algorithmed a video about the CHOP Protocol to me, an 8-month rehabilitation programme for people with POTS developed by the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and I decided I would try it. Things were so bad for me at the start of 2025 that I pulled out of lots of work things for the foreseeable (I am a writer who is supposed to be on a book tour), so now is the time to try it. Now is the best time if things go very, very wrong.


## MONTH 1 / posted: 29th may 2025

Really hard mentally and then really good mentally. Really hard physically, and then more exciting than hard. 

I found a low-key gym near my house and decided to use a rowing machine for my cardio days. I let the gym staff know what I was there for in case I fainted or something, and they were really welcoming and caring and supportive and vigilant. I printed the very long PDF the Chop Protocol is contained in, turned to the page for month 1 and wrote out a list of the machines I would use on strength training days on the right-hand side to try to get things straight in my head. It looked a little like this:

{{< figure src="/11.JPG" title="Fwiw, I really enjoy carrying a mysterious stapled wad of paper around the gym with me.">}}





I have a [Visible](https://join.makevisible.com/7378479ac2dd33) armband so I keep the app open and lean my phone on the rowing machine so I can see my heart rate. I have learnt that 1. I am desperate to go faster and harder but I shouldn’t 2. It’s easier for me to go slower if I don’t have headphones in and can listen to my breathing and 3. the Visible armband is the only way I can modulate myself because I can’t feel my heart accurately given the fact I’m on both beta blockers and midodrine. The protocol says that you should go at a pace that feels easy, but as someone who used to do a lot of sports before getting sick, that has been hard to follow, even in a body that has spent the best part of 4 years in bed. 

So I’m on the rowing machine 3 days a week and doing strength training on 2 days. Those strength training days were so hard-going to start with, that the crashes I had after the gym led me to a panic attack. I was just dreading the next crashes to come. There were tears and regrets and I dunno — I had to just keep telling myself it was normal. Of course I would feel terrible? I kept telling myself that the protocol suggests making it to month 5 before deciding whether to stop or not. Plus it feels like health is my full time job at the moment, and I didn’t want to quit so soon. 

And to be fair, the reason the column on the right of the image I posted is so scribbly is because over the first four weeks, I started on 10KG weights on most machines but was able to increase the weights on some to 25 and 30. I am already seeing the progress in one month, and god, that is gratifying. I keep a pen in my pocket when I go around the machines so I don’t lose track of these numbers. I can’t believe I ever went to a gym without pen and paper and a plan in the before times. The plan has made going the gym into a game. I love games! I want to win my health back.  

I’m really happy to be here at the end of month one. There is a bit more colour in my cheeks or something. I have been keen not to just go to the gym for the sake of going to the gym more, but to make sure I’m going to the gym in order to be able to do other things. So, in the last week, I broke up my 5 CHOP days and went to a gig in the park near my house. I stood for the longest I’ve stood in 4 years. It made me really emotional and proud. I know most of this is midodrine but a lot of is also overcoming the week one panic attack. Some of it is me as well. 

Random things to note:

—- I found a gym with no contract, so I can just pay month by month and opt out if things go wrong for me. 

—- I can’t afford taxis to the gym so I have to walk 20 minutes there and 20 minutes back. I was really, really worried about this but here in week 4, it is much easier than it was in week 1.

—- I stretch before I do anything. It hurt a lot when I started and now it’s more relaxing than anything.

—- I repeated week 3 because my boyfriend said I seemed a lot more tired than usual, and I’m so glad I repeated it because it made week 4 a piece of piss!

—- I take Midodrine at 9AM and 4PM and I always get to the gym for half an hour after one of those times. It’s nice to have a sense of routine again after 4 years of being inside an endless living nightmare. 

—- After week 2, I bought some gym clothes and wearing them makes me feel good.

—- I have B12 injections every month and I found that the day I went to the gym after my monthly injection, I was a bit hyperactive and I had to make a concerted effort to slow my heart rate down. 


## MONTH 2 TBC

Fml. I finished Month 1 at the end of May, got 1 week into Month 2 and then I had to stop. I got food poisoning that drained the life out of me and it took me that long to recover, because Long Covid has fucked my immune system, that I lost all strength, all stamina, all the colour in my cheeks and whatever. I am restarting the ENTIRE THING here at the END OF JULY because of how bad I feel. Plus it's summer, and POTS can't do summer, so my body is just fucking empty. I'm literally going back to Month 1, Day 1. See you in nine years when I finally get to Month 2

## MONTH 2 PROPER / posted: september 19th

oooo-weeeee. after restarting everything, i've finally finished month 2 and i'm FeeEeeeEeliiing Gooooood dum badum badum badum dunununun

{{< figure src="/2.JPG" title="my greatest achievement" >}}

It's such a step up but the 28 minutes I did this evening?? i could have done more. I'm feeling relaxed and capable and -- i think it's because the entire process of following these very detailed instructions, and keeping my eye on the Visible App when I'm using the rowing machine, are together allowing me to trust what I can and can't do with precision I didn't have before. And that's on top of Midodrine, which helped me feel way less sick this summer. I still took a fatigue hit but I didn't have the nausea this time around.

-- I decided to carry on going the gym unless it was over 25 degrees C.

-- I decided to take rest days when I needed them. (duh, but not duh when you're me)

-- I repeated the first week just to be safe.

-- And one time, in the final week, I went ham on a strength training day _because_ I was feeling so strong but then I couldn't move the next day. lesson learned! 

-- where it says GIG i popped an extra midodrine and went to a 45 minute gig instead. the fact that i can even decide to do that.........wild to me

-- I'm now having 2 SiS electrolyte tablets in a litre of water when I wake up, and ANOTHER 2 when I take my afternoon Midodrine with another litre. It is expensive but I can really feel the difference when I don't now so I will just have to firm it

-- i met someone today I hadn't seen since april and the first thing they said was that I'd lost weight ('and was I okay?'). I am not someone who ever thinks about weight so Idk if this is true or not. My theory is just that I probably look more human these days because I have a bit of colour in my cheeks. But I thought I'd mention it in case anyone reading cares about that stuff

see ya when i have month 3 in the bag 


## MONTH 3 / posted: october 19th

{{< figure src="/3.JPG" title="big jump up" >}}

this month was basically 30 minutes on a rowing machine over and over again, and then there were two days when I had to go at the Maximum Steady State i could handle, and two follow-up days with 40 minute rows at a gentle pace. I did it all. The weeks with the MSS sessions made me feel extra fatigued, like, to the point where I achieved little else those days. But overall, I felt great about myself. Great for having gone faster than normal. Great for seeing the numbers go bigger. Great also for seeing some of my strength training weights increase as below:

- Leg press 40 -> 50
- Calf raise 30 -> 40 
- Chest press 10 -> 15 
- Leg curl (lying down) 25 
- Leg curl (sitting up) 30 
- Leg extension 25 
- Pulley 15 -> 20 
- Adductor 35 -> 40 
- Rowing 15 -> 20 

But this is what I'll leave you with here at the end of month 3: I got really excited to tell people I'd done 40 minutes on a rowing machine, and friends and cousins were excited too, but when I told my boyfriend's mum she asked if I thought the POTS was going away then. My boyfriend answered before I could figure out how to word it myself. He said _the POTS is still there, she's still sick, but she's just beefing up so that she can handle the POTS better_ and -- yeah. that's it isn't it.

but the very next day, he asked if I wanted to go for a walk. we popped into charity shops and a supermarket and a greengrocers and -- oh no -- i felt myself shutting down, and by the time we hit the couch back home it had been an hour walking, and I just felt this horrible nausea, head empty, wiped state come over me. And I thought, wow I can do 40 minutes on a rowing machine and live to tell the tale but I cannot amble for an hour without ending up like this, and it's all because when i'm rowing, my legs are up. 

I have this fear that the chop protocol is gonna help me but only in very specific circumstances. but that's the comment of a girl at the end of month 3. month 4 week 1 introduces upright exercises so I'll be swapping the rowing machine for a bike; and by the end of month 4, I'll be on an elliptical. I think month 4 is what it's all been building to. I hope it is, anyway. I hope I can do it? I want it to beef my legs and reset my nervous system so that I can go to the bakery up the top and say yeah let's go to that shop down the other end of the road bla bla without bringing on a crash. 

I think I have 40% anxiety about what is about to happen but 60% hope and that's probably the best i can muster for now 

## MONTH 4 / posted: december 14th 

{{< figure src="/4.JPG" title="i did a lot of repeats" >}}

I have had massive ups and downs since I last wrote, and some bad news I'll get to. but let's get the technical stuff out the way:

It took 2 months to complete the 4th month of the programme because the move to upright exercise was so hard that I repeated the first few weeks on the bike multiple times until I felt ready to move on.  My back hurt the first week, and my arms were dripping in sweat to begin with. but by the end of it, I was just like, a bit bored? haha. I could do it but it made me miss the rowing machine for being so much more stimulating of an activity.

Fwiw, I tried doing the same 'speed' on the bike as I had been on the rowing machine by matching the calorie counter as a rough estimate?? i didn't know how else to translate speed from one machine to another and I think it worked well for me tbh. Don't ask me what a calorie means in practice, I make a point not to know. 

but yeah, it was hard. and slow. not just because of the position of my body, but because it coincided with me tapering off beta blockers. I did this section with half the beta blocker dose I've been taking for 4 years, and i'll be doing the next month with absolutely none. that's because i have upped my dose of midodrine from 5mg to 7.5 and as the two medicines sorta work against each other, it's time to see how far midodrine can take me without the beta blockers tampering things (however much I will miss them </3>)

More time meant a lot more strength training so...

- Leg press 50 -> 60  
- Calf press 40 -> 50 -> 60 
- Leg extension -> 30 -> 35 
- Leg curl sitting up 30 -> 35 
- Leg curl lying down 25 -> 30 
- Chest press 15 -> 20 
- Adductor 35 -> 40 

In the final week of this month, it says move onto training mode 3 so I braved the elliptical. i think because I had done so much extra bike time, it was actually doable. 30 entire minutes. I felt really emotional to be honest. I could have done more except my feet had gone completely fucking numb. As soon as I stepped off and walked across the gym to get out, I felt the blood returning to my feet and it felt weirdly incredible haha. 

So yeah, that's all the progress. But let's get onto the bad newssssss arrghhhhhhhh

I'll tell you as much as I know because it's relevant, and you can make of that what you will. I've had a sore throat for a while. I would tell you I've had it since Covid began January 2021, but that it was so far down my list of symptoms that I never brought it up to the doctor until recently. It had just gotten so much worse. If I did a lecture, or spoke to a friend for an hour, you could hear it in my voice. So the doctor sent me to EMT but told me it's probably just a symptom of chronic fatigue and not to worry. EMT put a camera down my throat and I could see on the screen how weird and yellow it was. He said to me, you've got acid reflux. the acid in your stomach is coming back up and it's damaging your throat. 'this will explain all your heartburn' and i was like uhhh but I don't have heartburn. so he left me with a diagnosis of silent reflux, or [Laryngopharyngeal reflux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngopharyngeal_reflux) and told me to eat and drink a low acid diet. 

As with so much UK healthcare I come across, it's a case of slapping a plaster of it and never so much as thinking about the root cause. But in my research since I've learnt that there's a shit load of things I was doing that can make your stomach acid come up and damage your throat, such as

1. BETA BLOCKERS hahahaha
2. chugging water, just like absolutely fucking chugging it because you have POTS and you've been told to clinically chug water, thereby overfilling your stomach and making the acid come up
3. chugging effervescent electrolytes is even worse
4. doing cardio straight after you have eaten 
5. Lying down after cardio
6. Lying down after eating
7. Lying down in general because then the stomach is level with your mouth and all the stomach stuff can come back, even though i HAVE POTS AND LYING DOWN IS THE ONLY THING THAT RELIEVES THE POTS SYMPTOMS   HA HA HAHAHAHA
8. HAVING POTS*

*because it's not a case of doing the things on this list = silent reflux. but it is the case that if you have dysautonomia, and your autonomic nervous system isn't functioning properly, then the lower oesophageal sphincter that is supposed to be a plug on your stomach can also be dysfunctional. I read one paper that said 60% of people with POTS develop LPR. Given so many people got POTS around the same time due to Covid, how many of us are going to develop LPR now? 

I am on PPIs and Gaviscon and a low acid diet until my throat heals, but what then? I stay on the low acid diet forever, even though I'm already on a low-medium glycemic diet to help me with POTS, and there's no fucking food left in the venn diagram between those two? Man alive. I have cried so much this month from the sheer overwhelm of how to feed myself. I've been so hungry because I haven't quite figured it out yet. 

And I know I will -- I know with any diagnosis it takes time, and the solution is always 'you have to be really prepared' but this is _food_. the thought of not being able to eat in restaurants or eat easily if I travel, that really takes the wind out of my sails when doing the CHOP protocol for example has given me such an appetite for travelling again. I really want to go to Chile in 2026 but if the pepsin in my stomach is still burning my throat... man i dunno how to proceed. I'm so sad. 

hopefully next month's update is coming from a different place. i am genuinely looking forward to going on the elliptical again. but yeah, just a warning about pots and lpr so you can keep an eye out for symptoms yourself, especially if you are introducing cardio into the mix TT 


## MONTH 5 / posted: jan 19th 

well that was quite prompt of me. hello, i did it basically in a month, give or take the few days when I was seeing friends over Christmas. I thought it was gonna be a more disruptive time but that many people were sick with covid and the flu, most of my plans got cancelled. Felt glad I'd been wearing a mask in the gym even if it makes dickheads come up and ask me why I'm wearing a mask all as a ruse so they can warn me I'm breathing in my own bacteria and making myself sick. suck my dickkkkk 

{{< figure src="/5.jpg" title="month 5 in all its glory" >}}

A full month on the elliptical bar the one day I thought 'what if I walked fast on a flat treadmill for a full hour just to see if I could do it.' I could do it. It was just funny getting off at the end and walking across the gym to leave because it felt like I was on a travellator. Reminded me of being a kid spending a full day in a pool on holiday and sitting at dinner later but feeling my legs wave as if I was still floating in water.

- Leg curl 35 -> 40 
- Leg extension 35 -> 40 
- Leg press 70 -> 80 
- Calf press 70 -> 80

It's been fun telling friends that I can do 40 minutes, or 60 minutes, on an elliptical and them going _I COULDN'T DO THAT_. Weird to feel like I'm overtaking normal people. Satisfying. But while there's the pride, the satisfaction, and more confidence, there's also a bit of 'wow I spend so much time in the gym almost every single day of the week, it is basically my job' as well as some '60 minutes is a long time to spend on an elliptical i'm a bit bored of all the music i like, and i can't concentrate on my audiobook, and i need something akin to techno to get me through this 40 minute MSS day' 

More seriously, I think in the elliptical with stationary arms, I might have found my limit-ish. Keeping an eye on my heart rate on the Visible app, I'm reaching 181 sometimes doing the elliptical. As a reminder, I'm currently taking 3x 2.5mg of Midodrine every day. I was only ever around 105-110 on the rowing machine, so the high numbers scared me and I had to look up what I should be aiming for, or not aiming for. I found the following [heart rate targets](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/target-heart-rates) on the British Heart Foundation. 

{{< figure src="/hr.png" title="from the British Heart Foundation website" >}}

I'm 31. If my max heart rate is estimated to be 185 and i'm hitting 181 on the elliptical........ ha ha. So when I say I've found my limit, I mean, I don't know if I _should_ actually progress to jogging on a treadmill if it means going over this figure and bringing on new problems. I haven't been booked back in for an appointment with my cardiologist yet so I have no one to ask in the meantime. But yeah. Maybe I just stick to the elliptical until I've had a chat with him? 

Before I sign off for the month: I am feeling 10% better mentally after the shitshow last month. I've been working my way through a [low acid cookbook](https://www.mollypelletier.com/flora-shop) and while I'm a lot less hungry than I was, I still haven't found food I'm dying to eat. My throat got a bit better, and then I ate something I shouldn't have, and it got bad again. But gym-wise, I am having to leave a full 2 hours between eating and going the gym otherwise I can now feel my throat burning. That or I get a bad taste in my mouth, so the silent part of silent reflux is getting easier to sus out. 

it's exciting to be at this point because the reason i decided to keep a blog was because I could only find on online that went up to the 5th month. we are in uncharted territory now. 

🤞🏻
