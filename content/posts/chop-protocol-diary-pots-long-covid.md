I usually post work updates on this website but I wanted to share my experience of doing the [CHOP Protocol](https://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/pdf/CHOP_Modified_Dallas_POTS_Exercise_Program.pdf) somewhere, because whilst there are a few videos online, I struggled to find complete blogs that didnâ€™t taper off after a few months. Also, my doctors donâ€™t know what it is and maybe yours donâ€™t either. _I will return to this page each month to share an update for anyone interested._

My starting point is that: I got sick with Long Covid January 2021, housebound for half a year, diagnosed with POTS January 2022 and had some help from beta blockers until a Covid reinfection in spring 2023 fucked me up even more. 2023-2025 was spent in an unending arm wrestle with fatigue, every single POTS symptom on the list, and Vasovagal syndrome. I really tried to do stuff but my body really didnâ€™t want me to. Then, in April 2025, my cardiologist started me on Midodrine and it felt so much easier to be in my body all of a sudden. I wanted to try building some stamina back up.

Obviously I donâ€™t know if I will be able to, or if post-exertional malaise will put its foot down. But YouTube fatefully algorithmed a video about the CHOP Protocol to me, an 8-month rehabilitation programme for people with POTS developed by the Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia, and I decided I would try it. Things were so bad for me at the start of 2025 that I pulled out of lots of work things for the foreseeable (I am a writer who is supposed to be on a book tour), so now is the time to try it. Now is the best time if things go very, very wrong.


## MONTH 1

Really hard mentally and then really good mentally. Really hard physically, and then more exciting than hard. 

I found a low-key gym near my house and decided to use a rowing machine for my cardio days. I let the gym staff know what I was there for in case I fainted or something, and they were really welcoming and caring and supportive and vigilant. I printed the very long PDF the Chop Protocol is contained in, turned to the page for month 1 and wrote out a list of the machines I would use on strength training days on the right-hand side to try to get things straight in my head. It looked a little like this:

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/NQwrilm.jpeg" title="Fwiw, I really enjoy carrying a mysterious stapled wad of paper around the gym with me." >}}





I have a [Visible](https://join.makevisible.com/7378479ac2dd33) armband so I keep the app open and lean my phone on the rowing machine so I can see my heart rate. I have learnt that 1. I am desperate to go faster and harder but I shouldnâ€™t 2. Itâ€™s easier for me to go slower if I donâ€™t have headphones in and can listen to my breathing and 3. the Visible armband is the only way I can modulate myself because I canâ€™t feel my heart accurately given the fact Iâ€™m on both beta blockers and midodrine. The protocol says that you should go at a pace that feels easy, but as someone who used to do a lot of sports before getting sick, that has been hard to follow, even in a body that has spent the best part of 4 years in bed. 

So Iâ€™m on the rowing machine 3 days a week and doing strength training on 2 days. Those strength training days were so hard-going to start with, that the crashes I had after the gym led me to a panic attack. I was just dreading the next crashes to come. There were tears and regrets and I dunno â€” I had to just keep telling myself it was normal. Of course I would feel terrible? I kept telling myself that the protocol suggests making it to month 5 before deciding whether to stop or not. Plus it feels like health is my full time job at the moment, and I didnâ€™t want to quit so soon. 

And to be fair, the reason the column on the right of the image I posted is so scribbly is because over the first four weeks, I started on 10KG weights on most machines but was able to increase the weights on some to 25 and 30. I am already seeing the progress in one month, and god, that is gratifying. I keep a pen in my pocket when I go around the machines so I donâ€™t lose track of these numbers. I canâ€™t believe I ever went to a gym without pen and paper and a plan in the before times. The plan has made going the gym into a game. I love games! I want to win my health back.  

Iâ€™m really happy to be here at the end of month one. There is a bit more colour in my cheeks or something. I have been keen not to just go to the gym for the sake of going to the gym more, but to make sure Iâ€™m going to the gym in order to be able to do other things. So, in the last week, I broke up my 5 CHOP days and went to a gig in the park near my house. I stood for the longest Iâ€™ve stood in 4 years. It made me really emotional and proud. I know most of this is midodrine but a lot of is also overcoming the week one panic attack. Some of it is me as well. 

Random things to note:

â€”- I found a gym with no contract, so I can just pay month by month and opt out if things go wrong for me. 

â€”- I canâ€™t afford taxis to the gym so I have to walk 20 minutes there and 20 minutes back. I was really, really worried about this but here in week 4, it is much easier than it was in week 1.

â€”- I stretch before I do anything. It hurt a lot when I started and now itâ€™s more relaxing than anything.

â€”- I repeated week 3 because my boyfriend said I seemed a lot more tired than usual, and Iâ€™m so glad I repeated it because it made week 4 a piece of piss!

â€”- I take Midodrine at 9AM and 4PM and I always get to the gym for half an hour after one of those times. Itâ€™s nice to have a sense of routine again after 4 years of being inside an endless living nightmare. 

â€”- After week 2, I bought some gym clothes and wearing them makes me feel good.

â€”- I have B12 injections every month and I found that the day I went to the gym after my monthly injection, I was a bit hyperactive and I had to make a concerted effort to slow my heart rate down. 


## MONTH 2 TBC
