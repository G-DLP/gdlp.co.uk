it's been a year since our book Poor Artists came out which means it's time for the paperback. We're launching it at an event at Foyles where we'll be in conversation with Morgan Quaintance. You can get a ticket [here](https://www.foyles.co.uk/events/poor-artists-gabrielle-de-la-puente-and-zarina-muhammad-in-conversation-with-morgan-quaintance)

we're doing another event at Van Gogh House but that's sold out so i won't link it...

and then something in manchester and norwich and newcastle but there's no event listings yet so i'll drop more links another time

anyway i've been told it's a sign things are going well in book world when you get to do paperback events so i'll leave that tidbit for my enemies bye bye
