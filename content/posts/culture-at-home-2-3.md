At the end of 2023, I began writing a column for Elephant called [Culture at Home](https://elephant.art/section/culture-at-home/). The first instalment was on [knitting and L√¶rke Bagger's book Close Knit](https://elephant.art/culture-at-home-on-knitting-and-laerke-baggers-book-close-knit/). The second instalment went up in December, and it was on [Photowork's Festival in a Box project](https://elephant.art/on-curation-renting-and-the-photoworks-festival-in-a-box/). Aaand I just checked back today to see the third text is up now too. The third one is on a [Youtuber called shiey](https://elephant.art/culture-at-home-on-shiey-youtubers-and-illegal-freedom/) who takes himself places he's not supposed to, and posts the evidence online.

Time to write no.4

And also: I found a job from now until April so thank you to the universe (of freelancers I know) and if the universe (of freelancers I know) wants to give me a job beyond April, then the universe (of freelancers I know) knows where to find me. besos xxxxxx
