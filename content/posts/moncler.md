I can't really drop a picture here to make it more interesting because the work we did was as ephermal as the subject, so you're just gonna have to believe me: in a funny turn of events, Dazed invited The White Pube to do an Instagram takeover at Moncler's [Art of Genius](https://monclerworld.moncler.com/genius/) event in the Olympia, LDN. We don't... do fashion. But the event was like a massive exhibition. 10(??) (man I'm so tired i can't remember) co-created collections were revealed for London Fashion Week in the form of installations rather than catwalk shows. We were brought in to do some art interpretation. It was a fun, mad night. Rick Owens put his arm around my shoulder and I thought he was Nick Cave. I am so good with celebrities because I literally do not recognise them. The takeover was fun tho and I hope we get invited back to do more if the fashion world ever does big mad exhibitions again xxxxx
