I did a blog post over on The White Pube about [everything I made in 2023](https://thewhitepube.co.uk/blog/2023-wrapped-gdlp/) across text and video, and reflected on how I managed to do anything at all given the fact my POTS is twice as bad as it was in 2022.

I also want to put it out to the Internet: if you are looking to give someone a 1 day a week job relating to writing, editing, social media, funding, community building or [insert the idea you had after reading the blog post aboout all the things I'm capable of] please get in touch on gabrielle@gdlp.co.uk

I really want a 1 day a week job to supplement my income next year. Honestly a 2 day job would be even better. And yeah, supplement my income but also just to put me in front of other ideas and people and tasks and creativity because I like variety. Okay that's all goodbyeeee happy new year GGs
