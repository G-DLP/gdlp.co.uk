This is nice. Photoworks invited me to be on a panel for the 2024 annual summit about access in art festivals, but instead of getting loads of trains to Brighton or Zooming in, I asked if I could submit a photo. I've been taking lots of film photos over the past year and there was one on my mind, of the mold on my bathroom ceiling. After starting my [Culture at Home](https://elephant.art/section/culture-at-home/) column on Elephant, I thought it was funny to see that in terms of another kind of culture. For Photoworks, I wrote a small text that would fit on the back of a postcard-sized print. They had it available at the summit but it's also on their website for people to order for free (just pay postage), thussss receiving a little bit of culture at home. The link is below:
