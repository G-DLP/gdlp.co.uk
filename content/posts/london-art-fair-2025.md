I did a flying visit to London Art Fair to speak about our book Poor Artists. We were in conversation with [Verity Babbs](https://www.veritybabbs.com) who was precise and funny and good at turning the book inside-out for anyone in the audience who hadn't read it yet. [BookBar](https://www.bookbaruk.com) were outside the door selling Poor Artists, and BookBar were great as well. And then I came home, ill, and I wrote [this text](https://thewhitepube.co.uk/texts/2025/london-art-fair/) about the experience of visiting the world of extreme wealth for one weird afternoon.
