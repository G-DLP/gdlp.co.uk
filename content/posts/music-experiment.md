i have been very depressed, I'm not gonna lie. I have realised that in depression, I find one thing I like and I hold onto it for dear life. I have also realised that to offset that, I am much happier when there's variety in my day. I eat something new for breakfast, I speak to someone I wouldn't usually speak to. Whatever. So, in an attempt to climb out of depression, I decided to listen to every album off NME's top 50 albums of 2021. My plan was to do it for the variety so I listened to every one from beginning to end even if I wasn't loving it, or even liking it. It was an exciting little experiment, and the bonus here is that I found a handful of things I really enjoyed so I'm going boil down that list of 50 to a list of the 5 albums I'll continue listening to now that my experiment is done. 

*   GLOW ON by Turnstile 
*   Smiling with No Teeth by Genesis Owusu
*   Juno by Remi Wolf
*   if i could make it go quiet by girl in red
*   For the first time by Black Country, New Road

I hadn't heard of any of these artists before listening so that's even better :D I've put some of the songs below if you want to listen, and here's the NME list I used if you want to do the same as I did: https://www.nme.com/big-reads/nme-best-albums-of-the-year-2021-3114833
