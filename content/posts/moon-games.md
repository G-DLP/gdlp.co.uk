99% of my work involves writing but every so often I get to work in a curatorial capacity. Tour de Moon got in touch to ask if we could find 4 young game developers under the age of 25. They wanted to commission people to make games that responded to typical game tropes, and they also had to use the zany aesthetic of the wider festival. Neon, marble effects, big shapes, abstract settings. I got in touch with a few universities, spread the word on Twitter, and trawled through all the Discord servers I'm on to find people. I'm 27 but it turns out everyone I know is older than me, not younger. I eventually found 4 game devs who fit the bill though. You can find info about their work below. I stuck around after the selection process to offer critical support as the games were in development, playing WIP builds and making sure everything stuck to the brief. It was fun. And I'm writing it here because honestly I would like to do more work like this in the future hint hint
