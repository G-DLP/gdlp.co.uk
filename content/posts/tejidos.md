I've been knitting for almost a year and I basically knit every day now. My camera roll is full of pictures of yarn, work-in-progress shots, my dress form. I thought it would be nice to make another Downpour, this time recording my knits. This is not work-related but I dunno, I like using this website to signal: I'm still alive.
