At the weekend, I was part of A-N's Assembly Leicester weekender that focused on disability rights, DIY activism and working in the arts. You can read the full programme [here](https://static.a-n.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/an-Assembly-Leicester-Programme-Oct22.pdf) which was led by Hannah Wallis and hosted by Two Queens.

I spoke on a panel titled 'On Locality and Access in the Arts' alongside Ashok Mistry and chaired by Gino Atwood, discussing online localities, centralised social media, and the limits of digital activism. It was a talk that made me think, hey, I should probably write this down. So I'll come back and update this if it makes it into essay form.
