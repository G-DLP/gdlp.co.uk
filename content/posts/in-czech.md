after I published a review of Poor Things, we got a really nice message from [Revue Prostor](https://revueprostor.cz) asking if they could translate the text into Czech for their website. Reaaaally nice really a very big compliment to know someone would want to invest time into my writing like that

you can read it [here](https://revueprostor.cz/chudacci-proc-mit-po-ruce-ostrou-dyku)!

thank you to Ond≈ôej Trho≈à for arranging and thank you to Nora T≈ô√≠skov√° for translating!!!!
