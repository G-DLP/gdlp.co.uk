As The White Pube, we haven't done a Big Proper Official interview in a while. To be honest, I didn't have anything new to say. Everything already existed in tweets and reviews and whatnot, so we turned them down for a while. Now felt like a good time to reintroduce ourselves through a very measured interview with the Norweigan publication Kunstkritikk. You can [read the piece here](https://kunstkritikk.com/critics-at-large/) in English or Norweigan. We were interview by Live DrÃ¸nen, with new images taken by Maria Gorodeckaya. Thanks to everyone involved, it was a pleasure!!! let me take this opportunity to also say: I love Norway and I hope to one day go back / let me take this second opportunity to say: I am so glad I am finally tracking all of these little things that happen in my professional life because I haven't ever done so on this scale, and it is doing wonders for my memory/sanity lol
