i spoke to Teen Vogue about Long Covid. I re-read what I said and I thought 'wow, that's dramatic' and then stopped and realised how dramatic this whole thing really is.

'Since long-haul COVID left Gabrielle housebound, sometimes she finds herself wanting only to talk to other chronically ill people. “They’re the only people that get it,” the 27-year-old says. Her life — once so expansive, full of work, travel, and plans to learn to drive a car and visit new countries — has shrunk. Now she only has the energy to deal with the present. “I can’t see what’s happening tomorrow or next week or a few years down the line. I can’t see if I’ll ever have kids because I can’t fully look after myself anymore. Everything feels futureless. And I think that futureless-ness is hard for people who aren’t sick to understand.”'
