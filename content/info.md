My name is Gabrielle de la Puente, Liverpool 📍 she/her

I am a writer. I like knitting, Overwatch, octagonal glasses, cousins, learning Chilean Spanish, and sitting one on one with a best friend in a restaurant for so long that all the tables around you change characters multiple times. 

I suffer a pie-chart of freelancing. The biggest slice is [The White Pube](https://thewhitepube.com), a website I have been co-running with [Zarina Muhammad](http://zarinamuhammad.com) since 2015. We published our debut book [Poor Artists](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/455873/poor-artists-by-pube-gabrielle-de-la-puente-and-zarina-muhammad-aka-the-white/9780241633762) in October 2024 with Particular (Penguin) in the UK and Prestel in North America. It has just been shortlisted for the Gordon Burn Prize. 

If I did not also suffer Long Covid and POTS, I think I would be an incredibly annoying digital nomad. As luck would have it, I own a black cat called Coco and a tortoiseshell called Piranesi, and I have knitting and Overwatch and octagonal glasses and cousins and an online tutor in Chile and -- I make do.
