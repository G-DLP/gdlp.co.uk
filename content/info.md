My name is Gabrielle de la Puente (b.94, Liverpool 📍)

I am a writer.

(✿◠‿◠) 🌸

I co-run The White Pube with Zarina Muhammad. On TWP, I publish criticism on video games and art. Reviews go out in text and we have a podcast for audio versions. We also run a Successful Funding Application Library and a Working Class Writers Grant. We think broadly about how we can make a better art world for everybody (one that is fair, accessible, and affordable).

You can support The White Pube on Patreon here:

I am starting to write fiction but don't tell anybody.

I also used to be a curator. I launched OUTPUT gallery in 2018, a space in Liverpool City Centre that works exclusively with creatives from or based in Merseyside. But I had to leave this job in 2021 when I got Long Covid. Maybe I'll be back one day? Let's see how this goes.
