My name is Gabrielle de la Puente (b.94, Liverpool 📍)

I am a writer.

I co-run The White Pube with Zarina Muhammad where I publish criticism on art, video games, and all the culture that gets on my nerves (for better or worse). We publish reviews in text, whilst audio versions go out on The White Pube podcast which is available to listen to on Apple, Spotify and all the rest. We also run a Successful Funding Application Library and a Working Class Writers Grant. We think broadly about how we can make a better art world for everybody (one that is fair, accessible, and affordable). 

The White Pube is funded by its readers on Patreon:

I am starting to write fiction but don't tell anybody.

On top of writing, I sometimes teach, edit, mentor, consult for arts organisations, select on exhibition open calls, chat about culture on other people's podcasts and do general art stuff like that.

In a not too distant past life, I also used to be a curator. I launched OUTPUT gallery in 2018, a space in Liverpool City Centre that works exclusively with creatives from or based in Merseyside. I had to leave this job in 2021 when I got Long Covid but it's still in action here: http://outputgallery.com (thank god).
