My name is Gabrielle de la Puente (b.94, Liverpool 📍)

I am a writer.

I co-run The White Pube with Zarina Muhammad where we publish criticism on art, video games, films, books, theatre and all the culture that gets on my nerves (for better or worse). We publish reviews in [text](https://thewhitepube.com), [audio](https://thewhitepube.co.uk/podcasts/) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3dcNljL17OyeC_BcG0WtBQ/featured).

We also run a [Successful Funding Application Library](https://thewhitepube.co.uk/funding-library/) and a [Working Class Creatives Grant](https://thewhitepube.co.uk/grants/). We think broadly about how we can make a better art world for everybody (one that is fair, accessible, and a lot more affordable). The White Pube is funded by its readers on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/thewhitepube).

Alongside The White Pube, I teach, edit, mentor, chair talks, consult for arts organisations, select on open calls and prizes, discuss art and games, and do general cultural stuff like that.

In a not too distant past life, I also used to be a curator. I launched [OUTPUT gallery]( http://outputgallery.com) in 2018, a space in Liverpool City Centre that works exclusively with creatives from or based in Merseyside. I had to leave this job in 2021 when I got Long Covid but it's still in action, thank god.
