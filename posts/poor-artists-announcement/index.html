Labelled ‚Äúthe Diet Prada of the art world‚Äù by British Vogue, in Poor Artists writers Gabrielle de la Puente and Zarina Muhammad ridicule a contemporary art world that has turned art into artworks, art schools into art universities, and creative expression into cut-throat competition.</em></p><p><em>Poor Artists follows aspiring artist Quest Talukdar as she embarks on a surreal journey into the creative industry, where she must decide whether she cares more about success or staying true to herself. Featuring dialogue from anonymous interviews with real people who have all had to ask themselves the same question ‚Äì including a Turner Prize winner or two, a recluse, a Venice Biennale fraudster, a communist messiah, a ghost, and a literal knight ‚Äì The White Pube tell the story of art like never before.&rsquo;</em></p><p>You can pre-order it now <a href=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/455873/poor-artists-by-pube-gabrielle-de-la-puente-and-zarina-muhammad-aka-the-white/9780241633762>here</a></p><p>(Gotta say, feels very satisfying to be able to link to Penguin&rsquo;s website)</p><p>You can read The Bookseller&rsquo;s announcement <a href="https://www.thebookseller.com/rights/particular-books-wins-four-way-auction-for-poor-artists-by-art-critic-duo-the-white-pube?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing">here</a></p><p>(Gotta say, feels very satisfying to be able to link to The Bookseller)</p></section><div class=post-tags></div></article></main><footer><hr>‚ö°Ô∏è
