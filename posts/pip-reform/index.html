i've been giving quotes</div><section class=body><p>My current health crash has coincided with the big 5 year Covid-in-the-UK anniversary <em>and</em> with the Labour government&rsquo;s new eugenic campaign. So I have been giving quotes to people, then reading them back thinking &lsquo;I should have been meaner about all of this.&rsquo;</p><ol><li><p><a href=https://www.creativereview.co.uk/long-covid-creatives-coping-pandemic/>I spoke to Creative Review about about the impact of Long Covid on the creative industry</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/66440/1/how-labours-benefits-cuts-will-impact-disabled-artists-welfare-universal-credit?utm_source=Link&amp;utm_medium=Link&amp;utm_campaign=RSSFeed&amp;utm_term=how-labour-s-benefits-cuts-will-impact-disabled-artists">I spoke to James Grieg for Dazed about how Labour&rsquo;s benefit cuts will impact disabled artists</a></p></li><li><p><a href=https://www.frieze.com/article/uk-welfare-cuts-will-harm-disabled-artists-opinion-2025>And then I spoke to Mariana Lemos for Frieze about more of that Labour shit</a></p></li></ol><p>I was explaining the welfare reforms to my Spanish teacher earlier today and doing so in a different language made me feel like I was telling lies. I am still waiting on the result of mandatory reconsideration to try to up my PIP from ¬£28.70 a week to something that actually has weight. For this to be happening right now is&mldr; well, it is not making me feel any better. In Spanish, they call Long Covid &lsquo;Covid persistente.&rsquo; In England where we have to work <em>because they&rsquo;re called the labour party so everyone has to buck up and work, even if working makes you sicker and sicker and sicker, until you seize, and then cease to be</em>, it is going to be Covid permanente for us all.</p></section><div class=post-tags></div></article></main><footer><hr>‚ö°Ô∏è
