the text itself isnt here, you gotta buy it soz</div><section class=body><p>I was invited to write about Long Covid for the Spring 2021 edition of Real Review. It was exciting because the Pope wrote something in the issue before me. I decided to look at all my symptoms, and reflect on how much my life had changed. It was the first time I&rsquo;d sat down to write about LC and LC only, and it killed me to do so. At first, I actually regretted writing this because I haaaadn&rsquo;t quite wanted to deal with how big of a change this had been for me. But looking back, I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s there. I&rsquo;m glad I have these different bits of writing to track the year so far. Even if I have better words now, I have the first words there too, recorded, naive and sad. Anyway, here is the link and here&rsquo;s a picture of the issue too. I was due to be in the summer issue but they wanted to bring my text forward (nice) except because it was a last minute change, my name accidentally got left off the list of authors on the back (bad) so you just gotta believe I&rsquo;m in there lol.</p><p><a href=https://real-review.org/product/real-review-11/>https://real-review.org/product/real-review-11/</a></p><figure><img src=https://i.ibb.co/8bLPLJm/IMG-6220.jpg><figcaption><h4>real review</h4></figcaption></figure></section><div class=post-tags></div></article></main><footer><hr>‚ö°Ô∏è
