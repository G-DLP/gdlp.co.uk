Poor Artists is out in 1 month</div><section class=body><p>I was enjoying keeping track of all my work on this website but I stopped updating for a few months because my chronic illness (POTS) is much worse in summer, so I&rsquo;ve been doing other things instead like: lying in bed and knitting and trying not to vomit and getting a kitten and <em>knowing</em> my book is coming out in October but not really <em>feeling</em> like somebody whose debut is coming out in October because I&rsquo;ve just been lying in bed and knitting etc. But here it is. I got a delivery of the US version this week. Here&rsquo;s a picture of the book alongside some of that knitting <em>and</em> some of that kitten:</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/pexmzu2.jpeg><figcaption><h4>Piranesi and Poor Artists</h4></figcaption></figure><p>A nice thing that&rsquo;s been happening over this summer sick time is that a few testimonials have come in from people who have read the book already. Natalie Olah said it was &lsquo;a landmark for art writing.&rsquo; Legacy Russell said it was &lsquo;an indispensable read.&rsquo; Travis Alabanza said &lsquo;I was surprised, challenged and affirmed - everything I love in a book.&rsquo; And Daisy Hildyard said &lsquo;This book might change the way you look at art&rsquo; :)</p><p>pre-order links are:</p><ol><li><a href=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/455873/poor-artists-by-pube-gabrielle-de-la-puente-and-zarina-muhammad-aka-the-white/9780241633762>here</a> for uk and europe</li><li><a href=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/761769/poor-artists-by-the-white-pube-zarina-muhammad-and-gabrielle-de-la-puente/>here</a> for US</li><li><a href=https://www.penguin.com.au/books/poor-artists-9781802062526>here</a> for australia</li></ol><p>but if you have a bookshop you prefer, then maybe check their site and order directly :)</p><p>i hope everyone has had a better summer than I have</p><p>üêà</p><p>p.s.
