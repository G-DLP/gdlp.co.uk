liverpool but it's a dystopian avian future ~</div><section class=body><p>Earlier this year, David Blandy invited me to write a supplement for his TTRPG series Lost Eons. This is the result:</p><p>Find The Haven of Aves here: <a href=https://davidblandy.itch.io/lost-eons-haven-of-aves>https://davidblandy.itch.io/lost-eons-haven-of-aves</a></p><p>&lsquo;A setting for LOST EONS based in a future Liverpool, an avian world of haves and have-nots. Featuring Art by Harriet Burns and a short story by Gabrielle de la Puente, enter a future world of water, misery and defiance.</p><p>Working with students at the Liverpool School of Art and Design at Liverpool John Moores University, Gabrielle de la Puente and David Blandy have created a future vision of Liverpool after climate collapse, that eerily echoes our own.</p><p>LOST EONS is solarpunk sci-fantasy. In Lost Eons you will emerge from the darkness into a new light, one dominated by inscrutable and terrible forces you must seek to understand. Using this guide create a post-human character in the Aves setting, ready to face the mysteries and dangers of a far future Earth.&rsquo;</p><figure><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMTMwODk4NS83NjEzODk0LmpwZw==/794x1000/svlPH4.jpg"><figcaption><h4>real review</h4></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMTMwODk4NS83NjEzOTA1LmpwZw==/794x1000/g5eYEp.jpg"><figcaption><h4>real review</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Now that all the official info is up, I can add my p.s. which is that I really enjoyed doing this. Over 2021 I wanted to try out different kinds of writing and then David invited me to do this. The workshop we ran with students was only a few weeks after I first got sick, so I was on Zoom in bed, camera off and just listening along trying to ready myself to synthesise the conversation into a game. The original workshop convo was a little bit more explicitly geared towards these vampire Liver bird creatures, who ended up turning into the more subtle Cygnus. And then I went from there, thinking about who existed underneath them, where, how, in what state. The Mortem filled that role and then the Maristi lightened everything so the Haven wasn&rsquo;t totally miserable. I mention the context to thank the students because I was so dead that day, and to thank David for his patience while I got the story together. Harriet Burns&rsquo; artwork just nailed the whole vision - my first time commissioning someone to illustrate writing I&rsquo;d done. Looooved it. Nice way to end 2021! If you play, I hope you enjoy it.</p></section><div class=post-tags></div></article></main><footer><hr>‚ö°Ô∏è
