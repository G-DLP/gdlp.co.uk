writing a book in the basement of Sirius Arts Centre</div><section class=body><p>The White Pube is currently in residency in <a href=http://www.siriusartscentre.ie>Sirius Arts Centre</a> in Cobh, County Cork, Ireland. It&rsquo;s our first official live-in residency in 7 years. We&rsquo;re here for 16 whole days. It&rsquo;s been very, very productive so far.</p><p>We&rsquo;re writing a book at the moment, which is something I cannot speak about in earnest because of other people&rsquo;s marketing timelines. But that is why we are here. Director <a href=https://www.instagram.com/miguelcurator/>Miguel Amado</a>, who we&rsquo;ve known for years now, got in touch to ask if there was any way Sirius might be able to support us at the moment &ndash; not knowing about the book panic we were feeling. Living in two different cities to run TWP is fine but living in two different cities to write a TWP book is not. Miguel very kindly invited us over to do a residency so we could get to work.</p><p>We did a panel talk with Miguel and <a href=https://www.instagram.com/perkigeo/>Georgia Perkins</a>, tracing our beginnings and our changing relationships with institutional criticism over the 7 years we&rsquo;ve been working.</p><figure><img src=https://i.ibb.co/1rV27Jb/IMG-20221210-WA0015-1.jpg><figcaption><h4>Sirius Arts Centre is in a very nice building</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Been meeting artists, falling in love with Ireland, walking up and down the quay, and making friends with the local cafe staff. We&rsquo;re about to book flights to come back in March so we can incubate and stay on top of book-writing, but carry on building a relationship with Co. Cork :) very grateful for everything on this blog post, just wanted to make sure my thank yous were online somewhere.</p></section><div class=post-tags></div></article></main><footer><hr>⚡️
