I just really love Vittles</div><section class=body><p><a href=https://www.vittlesmagazine.com/p/people-of-the-salt>https://www.vittlesmagazine.com/p/people-of-the-salt</a></p><p><a href=https://www.vittlesmagazine.com/p/people-of-the-salt>https://www.vittlesmagazine.com/p/people-of-the-salt</a></p><p><a href=https://www.vittlesmagazine.com/p/people-of-the-salt>https://www.vittlesmagazine.com/p/people-of-the-salt</a></p><p>there is a really good food newsletter called Vittles. I love and respect it. last month, I was thinking about how much I <em>have</em> to think about food nowadays, which is something I simply never used to do. Idk what I used to eat. Or drink. I know I never drank water. But then I got Covid and Long Covid and Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome and now all I do is stress about what I am going to eat. So, I sent Vittles an email pitching them on this absolutely ridiculous stress that I never asked for, and they said yes, and then they helped me edit it into what it is today: People of the Salt. Part of their Cooking From Life series. Really good pitching experience, even better editing experience. I continue to rate them so highly lmao. Here is the text! enjoy</p><p><a href=https://www.vittlesmagazine.com/p/people-of-the-salt>https://www.vittlesmagazine.com/p/people-of-the-salt</a></p><p><a href=https://www.vittlesmagazine.com/p/people-of-the-salt>https://www.vittlesmagazine.com/p/people-of-the-salt</a></p><p><a href=https://www.vittlesmagazine.com/p/people-of-the-salt>https://www.vittlesmagazine.com/p/people-of-the-salt</a></p></section><div class=post-tags></div></article></main><footer><hr><a class=soc href=https://twitter.com/gdlp__ title=Twitter><i data-feather=twitter></i></a>|‚ö°Ô∏è
