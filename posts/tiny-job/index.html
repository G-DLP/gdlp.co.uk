get in touch if something comes to mind</div><section class=body><p>Hey, I am looking for a one day a week job in arts/games/charity-work/idk what else. I used to run OUTPUT gallery alongside my work at The White Pube but I had to leave OUTPUT when I got Long Covid. I can&rsquo;t go back to that job - it&rsquo;s just too physical. I&rsquo;m not 100% recovered but I&rsquo;ve got enough life back in me to pick up a second job so I thought I&rsquo;d write this blog post. As a freelancer, I would like something straightforward to slot into my week. It would be great if it was on a fixed day every week because honestly I am craving a bit of structure. But it would also be good if there was some leeway because this work wasn&rsquo;t life or death, ie. if I can&rsquo;t work my usual regular Friday because Long Covid has spontaneously knocked me over, I can do it on the Saturday instead. I feel like that is a bad thing to say up front but fwiw, my health is much more stable now. Occassionally I do still have a bad day and I don&rsquo;t want that to be a secret.</p><p>As for the field of work I&rsquo;m looking for: I have most experience and expertise in writing and editing, I have been working in the art world for years now and can do plenty of art shit, got a lot of transferrable skills relevant for the community side of games, and I&rsquo;ve missed how meaningful my life felt when I was doing outreach work for charities so something like that could be good as well. But I&rsquo;m easy. If you know the work I do and have something in mind, get in touch.</p><p>My email address is <a href=mailto:gabrielle@gdlp.co.uk>gabrielle@gdlp.co.uk</a> and my Twitter is <a href=http://twitter.com/GDLP__ title=@GDLP__>@GDLP__</a> if you wanna talk there instead.</p><p>I would really appreciate your help. I have been so out of it since getting sick but I&rsquo;m back open for business and I would like to find a 2nd job to support my income but also add some variety back into my life after a weirdo year. I don&rsquo;t know if putting a blog post up like this is insane but I have a feeling it will work.</p></section><div class=post-tags></div></article></main><footer><hr><a class=soc href=https://twitter.com/gdlp__ title=Twitter><i data-feather=twitter></i></a>|‚ö°Ô∏è
