I&amp;rsquo;m taking care of the online stuff. Plaster have a podcast called Give Me A Break, discussing people&amp;rsquo;s entry into the arts. I was interviewed by Harriet Lloyd-Smith and ye sure it was probably supposed to a chance to talk about Poor Artists but I accidentally gave my life story instead. I remember it being very funny to record so hopefully it&amp;rsquo;s a funny listen :-)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The labour government are doing eugenics üëâ</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/pip-reform/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/pip-reform/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;My current health crash has coincided with the big 5 year Covid-in-the-UK anniversary &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; with the Labour government&amp;rsquo;s new eugenic campaign. So I have been giving quotes to people, then reading them back thinking &amp;lsquo;I should have been meaner about all of this.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.creativereview.co.uk/long-covid-creatives-coping-pandemic/"&gt;I spoke to Creative Review about about the impact of Long Covid on the creative industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Come year 4, I was dragged back out by a book tour because I was stupid enough to write a book. I&amp;rsquo;ve just entered year 5 and I have crashed big time in a way that reminds me of those dark times in years 1 and 3. I have cancelled a bunch of stuff including some national and international work trips. I&amp;rsquo;ve kept a very minimal amount of stuff still on the cards over the next four weeks, and then idk. I think I have to do the work of being chronically ill &amp;ndash; I have to rest, have to get back to a good baseline, have to try new things to feel better, stop doing other things that make me feel worse. I am someone who always says yes to freelance work opportunities because I need to be earning money to live, but I am entering a time where I need to say no so I don&amp;rsquo;t get any sicker than I already am. I still hope the book pays off and we earn out and get royalties one day, but we wrote a book about art haha, it&amp;rsquo;s not a rom-com. So, if you are reading this because you have googled my name on a hunt for an email address to send me a work opp, still send it? I might have to turn it down if it compromises my health but it&amp;rsquo;s still nice to be thought of. I might be able to say yes if it&amp;rsquo;s accessible to the year 5 state I&amp;rsquo;m in, but we can talk about that.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>speaking to Jen Calleja about goblins üëπ</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/goblinhood/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/goblinhood/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;on apr 3rd i&amp;rsquo;ll be at Dead Ink Bookshop to talk &amp;ldquo;GOBLINHOOD: GOBLIN AS A MODE,&amp;rsquo; an essay and poem collection by Jen Calleja that artfully propound her theory of &amp;ldquo;Goblin-hood&amp;rdquo; - taking in all aspects of pop culture from film, literature and art as well as the author&amp;rsquo;s personal and original examinations of grief, lust, family histories and the physical fact of living in the world as it is.

This all came about because at the end of 2024, after being on a panel with Orian for Edinburgh&amp;rsquo;s Radical Book Fair, I posted a text about &lt;a href="https://thewhitepube.co.uk/texts/2024/culture-is-bad-for-you/"&gt;how much money I have earned as a writer since I began in 2015&lt;/a&gt;.

I look forward to hashing it out in Manchester.

The reviews for Poor Artists have been almost exclusively really, really positive. More important than reviews are just normal people&amp;rsquo;s opinions and we&amp;rsquo;re getting the same message a lot &amp;ndash; that people feel like we have given them permission to make art for themselves again, the way they used to, instead of making it for the sake of the art industry or in the pursuit of &lt;em&gt;being a professional artist&lt;/em&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of emotional emails from people. A lot of emotional chats after talks and interviews about the book with people who feel like their love of art became toxic, and now they&amp;rsquo;re trying to reconnect with this need to make things on their own terms. I&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot of travelling over the past two months for those events, and I hope we get to do lots more. It&amp;rsquo;s cool seeing it in shops, and especially nice that it is in so many bookshop window displays.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Poor Artists is out now üòó</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/poor-artists-book-out-now/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/poor-artists-book-out-now/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The book came out!

But I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually write an essay. When I first sat down to watch it, I was struck by how many video game references it held and I decided to instead write about it in the style of a walkthrough. It was a lot of fun. Made me want walkthroughs instead of press releases for all artworks. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave the piece I wrote about below, and hopefully it encourages you to pick up the monograph. I am such a Hardeep fan. I have been to exhibitions of us in Berwick, New York, Birmingham, London.

Photoworks invited me to be on a panel for the 2024 annual summit about access in art festivals, but instead of getting loads of trains to Brighton or Zooming in, I asked if I could submit a photo. I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking lots of film photos over the past year and there was one on my mind, of the mold on my bathroom ceiling. After starting my &lt;a href="https://elephant.art/section/culture-at-home/"&gt;Culture at Home&lt;/a&gt; column on Elephant, I thought it was funny to see that in terms of another kind of culture. For Photoworks, I wrote a small text that would fit on the back of a postcard-sized print. They had it available at the summit but it&amp;rsquo;s also on their website for people to order for free (just pay postage), thussss receiving a little bit of culture at home.

&lt;p&gt;On October 3rd 2024, &lt;strong&gt;Poor Artists&lt;/strong&gt; will be published thanks to Penguin&amp;rsquo;s imprint Particular Press in the UK and Prestel in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;At a moment in which working as a professional artist is an increasingly unattainable luxury, art criticism duo The White Pube investigate why so many artists try anyway. Labelled ‚Äúthe Diet Prada of the art world‚Äù by British Vogue, in Poor Artists writers Gabrielle de la Puente and Zarina Muhammad ridicule a contemporary art world that has turned art into artworks, art schools into art universities, and creative expression into cut-throat competition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>made another Downpour-thing ‚òîÔ∏è</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/tejidos/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/tejidos/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been knitting for almost a year and I basically knit every day now.

The first instalment was on &lt;a href="https://elephant.art/culture-at-home-on-knitting-and-laerke-baggers-book-close-knit/"&gt;knitting and L√¶rke Bagger&amp;rsquo;s book Close Knit&lt;/a&gt;.

Elephant changed hands, the column got cut, and then we got a message from the new team asking if we wanted to pick it back up again. I think we were both dishing out advice. There&amp;rsquo;s only so much we know. So, we had a think about things we would genuinely &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to do and I proposed an individual column about Culture at Home. My time as a critic is split between the 2015-2020 era of being an international critic who was flying all over the place to see stuff, versus 2021-present, being a chronically ill critic who is almost always in the house. I have continued writing but I&amp;rsquo;ve never consciously said, this is all I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; write about. In this new column, I am doing exactly that. Column #1 is about L√¶rke Bagger&amp;rsquo;s book Close Knit. I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten really really really really really really really really into knitting this year, and Bagger&amp;rsquo;s book is one of those culture-things I have been able to fully appreciate without going outside. So here ya go.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>made a video about judging the john moores üé¨</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/john-moores-painting-prize-video/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/john-moores-painting-prize-video/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Art juror vlog.

My latest text is a roundabout review written from the perspective of an artist called Cody Senn. In my text, he&amp;rsquo;s called The Maggot Man.

But it was a good chat. Lots of laughs considering the extreme social horror category of her subject matter. I only asked her half the questions I had prepared because we got so deeply into the Internet as a setting, as inspiration, as a traumatising entity, and as a place that generates endless language for writers to work with.

You can listen or read the transcription &lt;a href="http://thewhitepube.co.uk/podcasts/nandos/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It was a great and also genuinely surprising and uplifting week learning more about the company invests in Southern African art &amp;ndash; art, something no one in the world can truly expect a return on investment from. It&amp;rsquo;s support for support&amp;rsquo;s sake. It&amp;rsquo;s mad? and good? And just not what I expected at all. We interview 3 artists who have worked with them &amp;ndash; Nkosinathi Quwe, Colijn Strydom, and Viven Kohler &amp;ndash; who were all brought over to exhibit at 154 art fair.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Writing with all the trademark verve and deliciously irreverent brio that de la Puente has become known for as a founder of The White Pube, Chaotic Nightclub Photos: The Review charts one art critic‚Äôs voracious appetite for the eponymous Twitter feed and its glut of flashbulb surrealism. Taking the reader back through the history of artistic representations of nightclubs, de la Puente finds herself asking why this chaotic, unhinged energy has so often been found wanting in the cultural depictions of night-time debauchery. Hugely intelligent, readable, personal, playful, and yet full of deft scholarship and deep knowledge, this is a vital contribution to the lore of the growing cult of Chaotic Nightclub Photos.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>on Soho Radio chatting about the club üì°</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/chaotic-nightclub-photos-soho-radio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/chaotic-nightclub-photos-soho-radio/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;in the run up to the &lt;a href="https://roughtradebooks.com/collections/editions/products/chaotic-nightclub-photos-the-review-gabrielle-de-la-puente-the-white-pube"&gt;Chaotic Nightclub Photos: The Review&lt;/a&gt; publication with Rough Trade Books as part of their nightlife series, I did a radio show with Dead Ink Bookshop and &lt;a href="https://roughtradebooks.com/collections/editions/products/deliria-jeff-young"&gt;Jeff Young&lt;/a&gt; who is also releasing a pamphlet.

&lt;p&gt;there is a really good food newsletter called Vittles. I love and respect it. last month, I was thinking about how much I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to think about food nowadays, which is something I simply never used to do. Idk what I used to eat. Or drink. I know I never drank water. But then I got Covid and Long Covid and Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome and now all I do is stress about what I am going to eat. So, I sent Vittles an email pitching them on this absolutely ridiculous stress that I never asked for, and they said yes, and then they helped me edit it into what it is today: People of the Salt. Part of their Cooking From Life series. Really good pitching experience, even better editing experience. I continue to rate them so highly lmao.

I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time to write it but I had fun. And then after I&amp;rsquo;d had my fun, Rough Trade Books got in touch asking if I would like to write a longer version as a part of their upcoming nightlife series. Yes pleaseee. More time to figure out what I wanted to say, more opportunity to put Gossip and Art History in there. It&amp;rsquo;s 11K words now and it&amp;rsquo;s much, much better. So I took the original text down from The White Pube website and podcast, and the only way to get the goods is to click on this link where you can buy the new ¬£7.99 pamphlet with all the goods inside it:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>spoke to BBC Radio 4 about taste</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/taste/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/taste/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Zarina and I had a chat with Zakia Sewell for her new BBC Radio 4 series &amp;lsquo;Taste.&amp;rsquo; We spoke about taste as an institutional force versus a personal one, our ethos with The White Pube, and why criticism is a sticky field in terms of power X_X&lt;/p&gt;

One of those doing-more-things involved writing a bizarro short story over 3 afternoons. I am just&amp;hellip; a little bit sick of reality, I guess. Little bit sick of sincerity. Little bit sick of reviewing things in ways that are to be expected. Felt like it was time to write in new ways and see what words came out.

I am very glad Elden Ring won. Chaotic choice in the eyes of some people, but I think it was doing the most to advance the multiplayer genre. &amp;lsquo;You need help and you can have help but only at great, finicky, risky cost&amp;rsquo; was so in keeping with the game&amp;rsquo;s narrative and challenge level. I was including the gamer-to-gamer peer-to-peer world that exists outside of a game, as well as the co-op that happens inside, and there&amp;rsquo;s no way I could have come to enjoy Elden Ring as much as I did without the player-built knowledge base around it.

We don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip; do fashion. But the event was like a massive exhibition. 10(??) (man I&amp;rsquo;m so tired i can&amp;rsquo;t remember) co-created collections were revealed for London Fashion Week in the form of installations rather than catwalk shows. We were brought in to do some art interpretation. It was a fun, mad night. Rick Owens put his arm around my shoulder and I thought he was Nick Cave. I am so good with celebrities because I literally do not recognise them. The takeover was fun tho and I hope we get invited back to do more if the fashion world ever does big mad exhibitions again xxxxx&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>a week in the life of a critic ‚úàÔ∏è</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/critic/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/critic/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;went to london for a week:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re writing a book at the moment, which is something I cannot speak about in earnest because of other people&amp;rsquo;s marketing timelines. But that is why we are here. Director &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/miguelcurator/"&gt;Miguel Amado&lt;/a&gt;, who we&amp;rsquo;ve known for years now, got in touch to ask if there was any way Sirius might be able to support us at the moment &amp;ndash; not knowing about the book panic we were feeling.

So, it was nice to be excited down to Leeds Beckett to teach on Game Studies, and for it to not be a lecture but an actual 2.5 hour lesson. I invited students to reflect on the culture they enjoy in their day to day life, to zoom out and think about what their enjoyment of it means, or fulfills. We looked at the inverse too. The group then worked backwards, thinking about how they felt about life right now, in general or personally. What kind of game mechanics would they design to compliment or alleviate the way they&amp;rsquo;re feeling? How can they give themselves the culture they need, &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; how can they bear this in mind later to project the same considerations onto game design to invite players into a certain emotional or social state?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>mubi partnership üìΩ</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/mubi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/mubi/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to nip onto my personal site to share that The White Pube is doing a brief partnership with Mubi to promote the release of the African Desperate by Martine Syms.

Tour de Moon got in touch to ask if we could find 4 young game developers under the age of 25. They wanted to commission people to make games that responded to typical game tropes, and they also had to use the zany aesthetic of the wider festival. Neon, marble effects, big shapes, abstract settings. I got in touch with a few universities, spread the word on Twitter, and trawled through all the Discord servers I&amp;rsquo;m on to find people. I&amp;rsquo;m 27 but it turns out everyone I know is older than me, not younger. I eventually found 4 game devs who fit the bill though. You can find info about their work below. I stuck around after the selection process to offer critical support as the games were in development, playing WIP builds and making sure everything stuck to the brief. It was fun. And I&amp;rsquo;m writing it here because honestly I would like to do more work like this in the future hint hint&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>spoke to Teen Vogue about Long Covid</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/teen-vogue/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/teen-vogue/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;i spoke to Teen Vogue about Long Covid. I re-read what I said and I thought &amp;lsquo;wow, that&amp;rsquo;s dramatic&amp;rsquo; and then stopped and realised how dramatic this whole thing really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Since long-haul COVID left Gabrielle housebound, sometimes she finds herself wanting only to talk to other chronically ill people. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre the only people that get it,‚Äù the 27-year-old says. Her life ‚Äî once so expansive, full of work, travel, and plans to learn to drive a car and visit new countries ‚Äî has shrunk. Now she only has the energy to deal with the present. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs happening tomorrow or next week or a few years down the line. I can‚Äôt see if I‚Äôll ever have kids because I can‚Äôt fully look after myself anymore. Everything feels futureless. And I think that futureless-ness is hard for people who aren‚Äôt sick to understand.‚Äù&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>My Long Covid is actually POTS?</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/long-covid-pots/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/long-covid-pots/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I had an appointment with the Long Covid Clinic in Liverpool (that has recently changed hands, moving from Aintree hospital to a health centre in Speke).

&lt;p&gt;Community Radio Tbilisi presents a monthly radio show A Beautiful Staircase in an Abandoned Building (ABSAB) by Ben Tupper, that explores the soundtracks of video games across various genres and console platforms. Each month, ABSAB features cuts of video game soundtracks curated around various cultural themes and selected by a guest artist with an affiliation for or working within video game culture. Video game soundtracks can be particularly unique in how they generate associations between memory, space and affect. With these associations in mind, ABSAB aims to provide a platform where guests and listeners can use the collected musical fragments of virtual worlds to explore the ‚Äòreal‚Äô phenomena of our material world.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>long covid treatment in Liverpool [UPDATED] üíÄ</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/long-covid-liverpool/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/long-covid-liverpool/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I thought it would be good to keep track of how I have (and haven‚Äôt) received support for Long Covid in Liverpool. By good I mean useful for other people in the same position. By good I also maybe mean an interesting document for people with other post viral illnesses who are looking at the reaction to Long Covid and feeling some type of way. So, this is my shitty timeline. And this is why I have lost faith in health professionals, or rather, the terribly organised structure that these health professionals work inside the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>ideas for a new art world üåè</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/pamphlet/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/pamphlet/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;this summer, Zarina and I released our first print publication as The White Pube in the form of a pamphlet for Rough Trade Books. It is #10 on their best seller list for 2021 which is cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can purchase the pamphlet here: &lt;a href="https://www.roughtrade.com/gb/the-white-pube/ideas-for-a-new-art-world/pamphlet-plus"&gt;https://www.roughtrade.com/gb/the-white-pube/ideas-for-a-new-art-world/pamphlet-plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;We are The White Pube and this pamphlet collects our ideas for a new art world. The art world is a bit broken. So many problems, such little time. Between January-April 2021, we plastered the distilled thoughts of years of writing on billboards and posters across the UK. We wanted to plop these aphorisms out there, as simple, feasible solutions; almost to prove how easy it can be if change is sincerely sought. The ideas are not radical, and they‚Äôre not new. They‚Äôre just six Very Good Ideas that we think you should listen to. In this pamphlet, we‚Äôve listed the six ideas and taken the time to explain why we think they are, in fact, Very Good Ideas. There could have been hundreds. Maybe there should have been. But these were the initial ideas for a new art world we went with. We hope they‚Äôll make you think about more Very Good Ideas too.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Haven of Aves ü¶¢</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/the-haven-of-aves/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/the-haven-of-aves/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, David Blandy invited me to write a supplement for his TTRPG series Lost Eons.

It was really helpful for me to write about being sick in order to process everything and make peace with it (if making peace is even possible). But I also resented writing about sickness, even when I felt the need to, because I hated how it would get stuck in my throat. Sometimes I‚Äôd start writing, find myself going off on a tangent about Covid, fight with the text, and then just give up and let it be loud like it wants to. Other times though, I managed to keep it quiet. Sometimes, I managed to write about something without giving Covid the airtime, and those happen to be my favourite texts of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Real Review üìö</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/real-review/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/real-review/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I was invited to write about Long Covid for the Spring 2021 edition of Real Review. It was exciting because the Pope wrote something in the issue before me. I decided to look at all my symptoms, and reflect on how much my life had changed. It was the first time I&amp;rsquo;d sat down to write about LC and LC only, and it killed me to do so. At first, I actually regretted writing this because I haaaadn&amp;rsquo;t quite wanted to deal with how big of a change this had been for me. But looking back, I&amp;rsquo;m glad it&amp;rsquo;s there. I&amp;rsquo;m glad I have these different bits of writing to track the year so far. Even if I have better words now, I have the first words there too, recorded, naive and sad. Anyway, here is the link and here&amp;rsquo;s a picture of the issue too. I was due to be in the summer issue but they wanted to bring my text forward (nice) except because it was a last minute change, my name accidentally got left off the list of authors on the back (bad) so you just gotta believe I&amp;rsquo;m in there lol.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Impact of Using Social Media as an Artist üë©üèª‚Äçüíª</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/art-report/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/art-report/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I am publishing the biggest thing I‚Äôve ever written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a document called ‚ÄòThe Impact of Using Social Media as an Artist.‚Äô Part report, it outlines how social media has become an important tool for work, networking and creativity. Part guide, it explains the differences between social media platforms, alongside tips, examples, and advice on safety and mental wellbeing online. Part conversation, it interviews different artists on their approach to social media (including Monique Jackson, v buckenham, the Kirkwood Brothers, Vince Laws, David Tovey and Babeworld). And part assessment, it looks at a recent commission that was shared on Instagram and Twitter to examine how arts organisations can best present artwork in online spaces.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
