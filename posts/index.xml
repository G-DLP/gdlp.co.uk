My enemies will celebrate my bad luck; I might lose out on future jobs if people know Iâ€™m a little weakling nowadays! But Iâ€™ve found it really, really tough to follow along with any personal accounts of Long Covid and putting words onto the Internet might help others figure things out for themselves.

At first, I actually regretted writing this because I haaaadn&amp;rsquo;t quite wanted to deal with how big of a change this had been for me.</description></item><item><title>The Haven of Aves</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/the-haven-of-aves/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/the-haven-of-aves/</guid><description>going to fill this in next week when it is launched shhh pretend you didn&amp;rsquo;t see this lol</description></item><item><title>The Impact of Using Social Media as an Artist</title><link>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/art-report/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gdlp.co.uk/posts/art-report/</guid><description>Today, I am publishing the biggest thing Iâ€™ve ever written.
