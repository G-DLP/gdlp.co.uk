submissions open February 13</div><section class=body><p>Very excited to be a juror on next year&rsquo;s <a href=https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/news/press-releases/jury-announced-john-moores-painting-prize-2023>John Moores Painting Prize</a> alongside Yu Hong, Claudette Johnson, Chila Kumari Singh Burman & Alexis Harding. And Zarina, obviously! I sent a quote for the press release but I will reiterate it here because &mldr; who reads press releases &mldr; not me</p><p>🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣</p><p>The White Pube’s Gabrielle de la Puente said: “When I had free periods in sixth form, my art teacher used to send me to the Walker Art Gallery. I&rsquo;d sit on my own in the room with the John Moores Painting Prize exhibition and get my arts education directly from all the paintings in there. When I became an art critic, I hoped I would get to be a juror on the prize one day, so this is a bit of a dream come true.”</p><p>They continue: “We like that this award is open to everybody, but we hope that those putting themselves forward understand that inclusion or exclusion does not mean a painting is good or bad - it simply speaks to the preferences of the jurors, and who are we anyway? Everybody should paint. There should be more paintings in the world. More art teachers should send students to see paintings exhibitions in free periods. We can&rsquo;t wait to see what the next John Moores Painting Prize exhibition looks like.”</p><p>🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣</p><figure><img src=https://images.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/styles/dynamic/public/2022-11/JMPP2023_Juror_Composite-01.jpg><figcaption><h4>exciting exciting exciting</h4></figcaption></figure><p>the way I feel like I have won the john moores painting prize haha god bless me</p></section><div class=post-tags></div></article></main><footer><hr>⚡️
